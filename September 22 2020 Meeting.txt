In the Shadow of Justice, Katrina Forrester
Settler-Colonial psychoses in Canada?
Connection of neoliberalism with liberalism/liberal theory?

Boltanski and Chiarello’s New Spirit of Capitalism
Werner Bonnefeld
Quinn Slobodian
Deleuze on axioms
Make it clearer when I’m quoting writers, etc.
Signposting, explicitly stating stakes, situate myself, etc. – Situating myself, I could be saying, well, Negri’s naïve affirmatism of the democracy of constituent power is all very well as a way of critiquing Taylor and Tully, but does it provide a way to deal adequately with the problems of Canadian politics (Indigenous and Quebecois sovereignty, trans rights, security and dispossession). 


* how do we use Negri's 'absolute procedure'?
* signposting
*when did neoliberalism start?
*could Deleuze ideas of axioms be of use?
*the definition of neoliberalism
*whether or not to include chapter 8 - I think we agreed probably not, but it's not entirely ruled out
