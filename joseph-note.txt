Miranda Joseph note
===============

“I am obviously using the term liberalism quite broadly here, including the full range of liberalisms from classic formulations (Locke), to all sides in the contemporary debates that have occurred in the wake of John Rawls’ work between (procedural) liberals and communitarians, to Habermas. While some participants in the communitarian/liberalism debate and some Habermasians would object to my characterization of them as liberal, it seems to me that they share many fundamental presuppositions. Most importantly, while they disagree about where the public/private line should be drawn, they all agree that such a line should be drawn somewhere. That is, while they disagree over whether individual rights or the common good should take precedence, they all accept the fundamental opposition between these categories. In a sense, given the assessment of even classical liberalism as implicitly communitarian, it seems to me that the key difference between them is that communitarians explicitly acknowledge and positively value the normatively that is implicit and disavowed in procedural liberalism. I find this debate frustratingly repetitive; the two positions endlessly evoke each other, presenting, as they do, two unacceptable options. And as Iris Marion Young argues, both positions rely on a logic of identity, a metaphysics of presence (Justice, 229). (While some communitarians articulate a notion of social construction of subjects, they tend, as Young points out, to posit these subjects as constructed in common or symmetrical and stable ways that enable transparent intersubjective communication, Craig Calhoun also makes this point in his critique of communitarianism [“The public good”].) The way out of this cyclical debate is through a Marxist poststructuralist theory of social processes as ongoingly productive of differentiated and dynamic subjects. This is the view that I will develop throughout the book. Wendy Brown also develops such a position in States of Injury (see especially “Rights and Losses”). And likewise Chantal Mouffe’s work, which I will discuss late, develops such a position, though she remains more within the frame of liberal theory than either Brown or I do, and in fact explicitly argues for the positive value of the public/private distinction.” \cite[180]{Joseph2002}
