Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit
=========================

The Phenomenology of Spirit (Phänomenlogie des Geistes) was written in 1807 as a response to Kant, but also as an introduction to philosophy for the high school students [[Hegel]] was teaching in Jena.

What I am especially interested in here is the question of [[Epistemology]] and the question of [[self-development]] or Bildung.
