 For Taylor and Tully - as for Rawls - while departures from strict individualist egalitarianism can and must be made for inequality (Rawls), collective goals (Taylor), or popular sovereignty (Tully), but that individuals or societies pre-exist relationships or associations. This a priori situation constitutes "freedom", and free social relationships must be a matter of choice. 

For Negri, on the other hand, the material necessity of history places social relationships first, as they do for Marx. The immutability of history \textit{produces} individuals and societies.  


IF as right, liberty, and capacity (of enlightened individuals). 

Critique of Taylor is that he thinks what matters is individual or natural.

“Acceptable inequality” as the second principle of justice in Rawls is manipulated for political purposes: denied at TPL, enshrined in policy at WPL.

Marxism excluded from Taylor for two reasons: the discrediting of Marxism after the fall of the Soviet Union (what Tully calls a “genuinely post-imperial age”, but also because of the materialism. Wittgenstein allows some of the benefits of theories of ideology without the political consequences.
