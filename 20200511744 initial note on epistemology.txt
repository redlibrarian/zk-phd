Epistemology
==========

Classical or mediaeval [[metaphysics]] tends to include all the things we would think of as [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]]. Early Modern philosophy starting with Descartes began to destabilize the metaphysics of scholasticism (either in its Platonic or Aristotelian sense) and also began the division between epistemology and ontology. In a large sense this was due to the influence of the [[scientific revolution]] on questions of knowledge and being. The Early Modern rationalists like Descartes, Leibniz, and [[Spinoza]] thought that through reason alone the questions of metaphysics could be answered. So, while the rationalists tried to dispense with Greek metaphysics, and to put metaphysics on a more scientific (logical, rationalistic, non-empirical) basis, they were faced with the challenge posed by [[empiricism]] particularly British philosophers like Bacon and (later) [[Hume]]. For the empiricists, rather than reason (alone) providing knowledge, knowledge was derived from sense-experience. Some rationalists and empiricists might have seen things as 100& rational or empirical, but for most it was a question of degree.

Hume “reduced metaphysics to rubble” through his scepticism and empiricism, which led him to conclude not only that all knowledge comes from sensory perceptions but that knowledge only comes from sensory perceptions. To be is to be perceived, and if it can’t be (or isn’t) perceived, then it does not exist. Not only does this do for metaphysics, but it does for any kind of scientific knowledge; and as Bhaskar points out, Hume himself doesn’t go this far when talking about science. There are always things we assume to be the case that are unperceivable/unperceived. Those things form the ontology, which is one of the things Hume tried to get rid of. The problems for scientific knowledge - and for knowledge in general - are pretty earth shattering if true, and so Kant set himself the project to demonstrate that some kinds of non-empirical knowledge could be true/known (synthetic a priori: descriptive statements about the world, not just tautological or definitional). In order to salvage this - to make science/knowledge possible - Kant had to reduce its scope. Rather than empiricism’s claim that our perceptions, limited as they are, are of the real world, Kant said that scientific knowledge could be true about the phenomenal world (the world as it impinges on our perceptions) but not of the noumenal world beyond it. And he goes further, in that the “true” knowledge of the phenomenal world is structured by our minds (i.e. not “true” in an objective sense, but only subjectively). So Kant reconstructs a limited ontology to make science/knowledge possible, but at the expense of bracketing off a “real world” unknowable by us. Metaphysics, in this sense, becomes restricted to the non-empirical structuring categories of the phenomenal world, as opposed to the more general metaphysics of Aristotle, Aquinas, Descartes, Leibniz, or Spinoza. qqq
