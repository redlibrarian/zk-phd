Taylor argues that there is a liberal “prodecuralism” of uniform, homogeneous, individual rights (Rousseau, Kant, Rawls) which is criticized as erasing difference. These societies do not have a “substantive” view of the good, but they implement procedural uniformity on rights to ensure that individuals can pursue whatever they see as the good. On the other hand, he argues that “distinct” societies like Quebec have a collective view of the good, a mission, a goal, and so they take “infringements” of individual rights as good and proper so long as they further their social view of the good. Taylor sees the multicultural debates in Canada (like the Meech Lake Accord) as a conflict between a procedural liberalism holding in English Canada and a collective, goal-oriented society in Quebec. However, this presumes that the procedural liberalism of English Canada truly doesn’t have a substantive view of the good, which of course Marxists would deny. The good, in the view of liberal capitalism, is profit and private property, and a whole bunch of things (rights) flow from that. 

It’s significant that Taylor doesn’t mention Elijah Harper in his discussion of Meech Lake - he makes it sound like “liberal” English Canada objected to Quebec’s illiberal preferential treatment. And while that was certainly part of the story, Indigenous people felt they had not been consulted and their own distinct cultures were ignored. 

Also, notice the switching back and forth between survival, difference, and recognition, and *cultural* survival, *cultural* difference, and *cultural* recognition. Taylor can’t handle the idea that differences would not be cultural (i.e. transgender people, which aren’t a “cultural” group, or modes of production).
