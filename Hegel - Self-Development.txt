Hegel - Theory of Self-Development
============================

(Includes his theory of freedom).

If I’m understanding correctly, Hegel objects not only to Kant’s static and ahistorical (transhistorical?) epistemology based on universal categories (Critique of Pure Reason), but he also objects to Kant’s ethics and theory of freedom, based as it is on a static and transhistorical theory of human nature. If Kant sees human nature as always consisting of an antagonism between reason and passion, then Hegel sees the subjectivity of a given moment as dialectically and historically produced. The dialectical moments of reason in the Phenomenology of Spirit are also the dialectical moments of emancipation. Again, this may be why someone like Jameson objects to the notion of [[Hegel - Closure]] or teleology, in that it presumes not only that reason becomes absolute, but that we all become free, and that history ends. It’s a hard idea for us postmodernists to swallow.

The relevance of this discussion, at least in part, is due to the relationship in Hegel of freedom to necessity, and how in absolute intellectual freedom, the idea of necessity is lost.
