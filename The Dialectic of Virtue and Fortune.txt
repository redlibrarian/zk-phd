The individualistic theory of identity supports an “intellectual freedom constitutionalism” in librarianship, in which self-determining individuals’ free choice of intellectual activity, ideas, values, etc, leads to an informed citizenry which is a necessary condition for democracy. The generative theory of identity formation challenges this idea and opens space for Negri’s theory of constituent power. What effects does this have on intellectual freedom and the self-images of libraries as “arsenals of a democratic culture”?
