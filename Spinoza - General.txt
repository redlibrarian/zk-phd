Baruch Spinoza (Benedict de Spinoza), 1632-1677.
=======================================

Early Modern rationalist. Proposed a monistic metaphysics in contrast to Descartes’ dualistic (mind-matter) metaphysics, in which there is only one substance (metaphysical term) that is “God, or Nature”, eternal (in the sense of timeless rather than of infinite duration) and infinite. In this view “mind” and “matter” (or thought and extension) are just two modes by which we understand and experience this single substance. [[Negri]] uses Spinoza’s philosophy to underpin his political theory. Something else to explore is the connection between Hegel’s thought and Spinoza’s, even though the two have often been considered to be quite distinct, recent thinking shows they have more in common than previously thought (cf. Karen Ng, Hegel’s Concept of Life).
