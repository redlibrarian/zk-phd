Negri, Antonio (1970/2020). “Rereading Hegel, The Philosopher of Right”. 

Negri sees Hegel as misreading Spinoza. However, he has some interesting things to say about Hegel’s concern over socialization (and thus his importance to a world of socialized labour). I think this fits with [[Hegel - Concept of Identity Formation]] that Taylor misunderstands and Honneth insists upon.

Jameson, Fredric. (2009). “Hegel and Reification” in *Valences of the Dialectic*. Jameson says that Hegel saw himself as “a competitor of Spinoza”, and at various points Jameson sees Hegel’s Absolute as the equivalent of Spinoza’s substance (God, or Nature).
