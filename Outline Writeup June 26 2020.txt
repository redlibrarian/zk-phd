1. Introduction: Resurgence of the People

This chapter will provide an introduction to “librarianship” (as professional practice and academic discipline) and “intellectual freedom” (as librarianship’s way of framing free speech/free expression). It will then frame the perennial debate between IF and social responsibility as being particularly acute within the multicultural/multinational politics of Canada. This will lead into a literature review of the politics of recognition and its critique, and will point to the individualism and idealism of liberalism as preventing the tension between IF and social responsibility from being resolved. It will then touch on the proposal that Negri’s (radical democratic) constituent power theory can help unify the various critiques of the politics of recognition in order to frame a new way of thinking about intellectual freedom. It will then explain the choice of case studies and lay out the rest of the book.
