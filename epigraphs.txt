“This mode of thought, going back as it does to Locke, is, I believe, ultimately political in inspiration; and it would not be difficult, following the lines pursued by Lukács in History and Class Consciousness for rationalizing and universalizing thought, to show how such thinking is characterized by a turning away of the eyes, a preference for segments and isolated objects, as a way to avoid observation of those larger wholes and totalities which if they had to be seen would force the mind in the long run into uncomfortable social and political conclusions.” Jameson, Prison House of Language, 24.
