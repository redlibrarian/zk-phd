We discussed the outcome of the first year progress meeting - all of which seemed to be very satisfactory and no major problems identified.

We then also discussed the thesis plan - which documents each of the chapters currently being planned , with a synopsis of each chapter. This provides a coherent and well thought-through overview of the thesis, which is especially impressive for the stage we are currently at in the PhD project.

Some questions came up which are worth considering:

*In what way is Hegel read differently by Taylor and Honneth?
*Is it helpful or potentially problematic to do a Negri-influenced approach that is dialectical?
*How do we expect the theory of intellectual freedom developed by Popowich to inform the empirical cases? Note also that this is likely to change once the actual writing starts.
*In terms of identify aporia - it might be helpful to make it more clear in what way the 'standard' approach in librarianship is liberal in terms of its underpinnings. And to make explicitly clear at an early stage in the dissertation why this is going to be critiqued (i.e. what is wrong with librarianship?)
*It might be interesting to engage with questions of space, considering that the 3 case studies are each focused on space in some way.

The timetable needs to be adjusted to include the interviews for chapter 8 (workplace speech).

To do for next meeting:
1. ethics review for interviews
2. write up in more detail a discussion on the liberal-communitarian debate (which will eventually go into chapters 1 and/or 2).
