Charles Taylor’s Source of the Self.

The two main things about this book are a) its idealism (for Taylor social formations, ethics, etc, are all determined by what people think) and b) its individualism - despite Taylor’s “communitarian” approach, he still sees “self” and “identity” as self-caused, self-formed, and as “coming to” social relationships after their formation. This is a common view in liberal philosophy, one which a collectivist theory can challenge. It is also significant that Taylor draws on Hegel (in [[Taylor - Politics of Recognition]]) as the source of his communitarian, intersubjective understanding of society, when [[Honneth - Struggle for Recognition]] argues that Hegel’s view of identity-formation is precisely that it is social and historical.
