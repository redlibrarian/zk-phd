It looks like both Taylor and Tully have a conception of identity in which not only are practices of subjection imposed on individuals post hoc (Tully follows Foucault in arguing that singularities are not passively acted upon by dynamics of subjection, but are active and knowing participants), but even more crucially that they can achieve a Kantian enlightenment by escaping the constraints of subjectivity into a condition of freedom and autonomy (both Tully and Taylor claim this comes about through the ability to think differently, to imagine alternatives). Taylor comes to this via Hegel - think of the path of the Phenomenology of Spirit - while Tully comes to it via Wittgenstein and Foucault. I think that for Negri - eschewing Kant and deriving his position from Spinoza - the act of emancipation does not deliver subjects into a condition of freedom and autonomy but a condition of necessity and community.
