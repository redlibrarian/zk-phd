Constituent Power and the Politics of Recognition: The Case of Intellectual Freedom in Canadian Libraries.

Possible epigraphs:

“… while it is important not to overstate and oversimplify the idea that public libraries in their early phase operated as mechanisms of social control, where middle-class reformers and librarians imposed their culture on a ‘distanced’ working-class clientele, it is none the less a matter of historical fact that, generally speaking, an appreciation of plebeian cultural networks and popular culture was overshadowed by the need to propagate establishment, ‘acceptable’ forms of cultural production and political belief.” Black, Pepper, Bagshaw, Books, Buildings and Social Engineering.

“They were convinced that the reading of good literature would correct social perspective and reinforce the socially found values that they held in such high esteem.” Wiegand, The Politics of an Emerging Profession, p. 230.

“The contemporary state is above all control over social labour and organization of living labour.” Negri, “Rereading Hegel, the Philosopher of Right”.
