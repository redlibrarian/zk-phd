Indeed, in Honneth (1995)’s reading, the development of identity out of already existing social relations is crucial for Hegel’s critique of individualistic social theory [#honneth-struggle]. It is ironic, then, that Taylor’s attempt to do the same thing (offer a communitarian, “dialogic” conception of identity formation) fails to take this reading of Hegel into account and reproduces the individualist conception of identity in liberal terms.
