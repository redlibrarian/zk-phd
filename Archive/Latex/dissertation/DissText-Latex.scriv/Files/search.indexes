            <Title>Liberal-Communitarian Debate and Constituent Power</Title>
            <Text>The liberal-communitarian debate is usually understood as a response to multiculturalism, the multinational polities of post-colonialism, and the rise of new social movements. In this sense, communitarianism is a way to bring group identity, communal difference, and minority rights into the individualistic framework of classical liberalism reaffirmed at the dawn of neoliberalism in John Rawls’ theory of justice. However, communitarianism (Taylor), constitutionalism “in an age of diversity” (Tully), and minority rights (Kymlicka) all define social and political difference narrowly, in order to bring national, cultural, or identity demands into conformity with liberal constitutional norms and best practices. Thus, for Kymlicka, the demands of polyethnic minorities may be congruent or tolerable by liberalism’s framework of individual rights, but the demands of multiethnic minorities are not. How are we to understand the curbing of demands in the name of liberal constitutionalism? From an intra-liberal perspective - i.e. within the terms of the liberal-communitarian debate itself - we cannot. But if we look at this question from the perspective of constituent power developed by Negri at the same time as the theoretical perspectives of the politics of recognition were being worked out, we can gain a better understanding of recognition, communitarianism, and its inadequacy to contemporary claims for social justice.
Negri’s book on constituent power (originally published in 1992, English translation in 1999), opens with an interrogation of the ways in which juridical and political theory unconsciously circumscribe, weaken, and neutralize the power of the multitude. While juridical theory posits constituent power either as either 1) a transcendent force outside the norms and institutions of the law; 2) immanent to the law, but having no power of its own as such; or 3) having the law as its logical conclusion, constitutional theory sees constituent power as an unruly, violent, unstable power which is rationally stabilized and controlled by the legitimate power of constitutional norms and laws. The classic expression of this is of course the Hobbesian view of constituent power as the war of all against all which must be constrained and limited by sovereignty in order to defuse its destructive capacity.
In its Lockean expression, constituent power must become legitimate through the self-adoption of constitutional limits (“checks and balances”) which, in Negri’s view, in fact destroy the absolute democratic force of constituent power itself.
It is no surprise, then, that in Canadian politics, the question of constituent power returned in the wake of the patriation of the constitution in 1982, in which the British North America act of 1867 was taken over - with a few amendments, such as the addition of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms -  as the basis of a Canadian constitution. Lacking a “constitutional moment”, a process in which Canadian society would decide on its own constitution, its own set of legislative and juridical norms (i.e. there was no constituent assembly), it was immediately faced with both polyethnic and multinational demands (from Quebec nationalists, immigrants, and Indigenous peoples) which it has been unable to resolve. While some of these demands are in abeyance (like Quebecois sovereignty) and others continue to challenge the Canadian state and society (like Indigenous sovereignty and anti-Indigenous racism), still more are new challenges to the liberal individualism that underpins Canadian political self-understanding (notable, BlackLivesMatter and trans rights).
The politics of recognition - as a theoretical offshoot of the liberal-communitarian debate - takes as its starting point individual rights and relationships between individuals. Minority rights and communal demands are understood as ways to balance this foundational individualism without challenging the rational primacy of individual rights. Negri, on the other hand, starts from the opposite perspective, that of the already existing multitude which liberal constitutionalism binds in networks of procedures and laws that are based, not on the community, but on individuals. The question then becomes whether - and how - constituent power can provide better solutions to the demands for trans rights, Indigenous equality, and workers’ rights than even a communitarian liberalism.
Negri argues that neither juridical nor constitutional theory have ever been able to fully resolve the challenge posed by constituent power. His investigation of constituent power therefore focuses on the reasons why such a resolution is impossible. With respect to the politics of recognition, the question becomes how (or whether) constituent power can serve to unify the criticisms of recognition posed by Indigenous scholars like Glen Sean Coulthard, feminists like Nancy Fraser, and trans activists like Dean Spade, without losing their specific valences and strategic perspectives.</Text>

Foreward
Non-fiction works often feature a foreword or preface. This usually comes after the table of contents, but not always—sometimes the foreword precedes the table of contents. If you need your foreword to come before the table of contents, move the \tableofcontents command in the “Preamble Addendum” document after “Foreword” document. You can also rename “Foreword” to ”Preface” or ”Introduction”, or delete it entirely, depending on your requirements.
The table of contents is generated automatically by LATEX, using the natural structure of the Draft folder’s outline in Scrivener’s. If you were using Scrivener in a more typical fashion, there would be a long list of instructions here on how to create a table of contents and manually keep it up to date over time.

Folder Names as Chapter Titles
The goal of this template is make the composition and drafting phase as simple and elegant as possible. It is not meant to turn Scrivener, a rich text editor, into a full-blown LaTeX generator (you’ll need to use MultiMarkdown or Pandoc for that). Instead, this project contains a number of convenience features that could be applied to your work as you wish in an la carte fashion, to alleviate how much code you’d need to type in yourself. For example, if you find handling images to be cumbersome in LaTeX, you can safely leave that up to the template.
Ultimately, it’s goal is to cater to those that by and large prefer to compose directly in LaTeX itself, and will be approaching Scrivener primarily as an organ- isational and composition tool for constructing a longer .tex file from the smaller snippets written into the Draft folder.
1.1 How To Use This Template
1. Inside the “Draft” folder, create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter num- bering will typically be taken care of automatically by LaTeX.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
2. Create a new text document for each section inside the chapter folders. Sec- tions will be numbered and titled by LaTeX using hierarchical numbering (1.1, 1.2, 1.3).
3. Nest documents beneath documents to create numbered subsections, subsub- sections and unnumbered paragraphs, at 3rd, 4th and 5th levels of hierarchy respectively.

CHAPTER 1. FOLDER NAMES AS CHAPTER TITLES 2
4. If you need to create the occasional unnumbered section, the Informal Chap-
ter and Informal Section Types are there for you.
5. If you don’t require a foreword, move the “Foreword” document in the Front Matter folder to the Trash folder. Alternatively, rename it “Preface”, “Ab- stract” or “Introduction” as you require. Any other prefacing materials could be placed between the preamble and the main matter document.
6. “Notes” and “Ideas” folders have been provided for your convenience, al- though you can replace them or create different top-level folders for your research materials if necessary (these are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents&gt;Change Icon feature).
1.2 Some Sample Content
Foremost, any LaTeX you type in yourself will be dutifully conveyed to the output. The compile settings also have a few shortcuts you can use to ease typing, or grant yourself a nicer looking working document. Graphics that you place into the editor (linked or embedded) will be exported simply wherever they occur in the text. For more formal figures there are two approaches you can take (you needn’t commit to either exclusively).
Figures
Figure 1.1: This is the caption.
To modify how styled text is converted to LaTeX code, visit the Markup and Styles compile format panes, when editing this project’s ”LaTeX (Memoir Book)” format. The Markup pane itself sets how graphics print themselves, which is the \includegraphics line alone. The stylesheet settings for Figure, Caption and Label determine how the additional syntax is added around that.
￼
CHAPTER 1. FOLDER NAMES AS CHAPTER TITLES 3 Equations
We can also insert equations as discrete items in the binder, making them easy to reference and look up by type. It also means we can refer to them in our writings with the use of simple internal document links (Equation 1.1).
x2 = 5−√25−4×6 =2 (1.1) 2
When you need to refer to an equation in the body text (β = (β1, β2, . . . , βn)), you can use the Inline Equation style which will insert the $ and $ codes for you.
Equations can also be inserted unnumbered

Another Chapter Folder
Begin each new chapter on a new top level folder like this. With LaTeX, the chapter numbering and formatting is handled automatically by the typesetting engine. Scrivener is only responsible for assembling the LaTeX code that will be used to generate these structures.
If you need parts, or if you don’t need chapters, the automatic assignment of structure to the outline can be adjusted in project settings, under the Section Types pane.

            <Title>The Multicultural Context of the Canadian Politics of Recognition</Title>
            <Text>In Canada, the political theory of recognition, minority, and group rights played a significant role in real political debates since the 1970s, but especially in the period of Indigenous resurgence and Quebec nationalism in the early to mid 1990s. As we have seen, the neoliberal turn of the 1970s disposed of the post-war consensus which papered over racial, gender, and class antagonisms in the name of social solidarity. By the late 1960s the question of ethnic minorities in particular returned with a vengeance, in the context of wars of liberation (Algeria, Vietnam), immigration (Enoch Powell’s “Rivers of Blood” speech in 1968), and decolonization more generally. The interwar period had seen the development of a system of bilateral treaties designed to protect ethnic minority rights and enable the the “national self-determination” enshrined in Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points within a system of multiethnic and multinational empires. As \cite[2]{kymlicka-1995} points out, by 1939 this system had become unworkable, and Hitler was able to justify the invasion of Poland and Czechoslovakia and the Austria anschluss on the basis of the self-determination of ethnic Germans (i.e. the “Heim ins Reich” policy). The anti-imperial struggles of the 1940s-1960s (India, Algeria, Kenya, Congo, etc) dovetailed with struggles for individual self-determination in the face of out-of-date establishment cultures in Europe and America. For example, the May 1968 uprisings in France were formed by a combination of new left-wing agitation (students in addition to workers), expressions of radical individual self-determination, and post-colonial immigrant experience, though the relationship between these three dynamics is not as simple as was once believed. As Maud Anne Bracke writes,
\begin{quote}
	“’1968’, this, meant France’s definite shift to postcoloniality. While de-colonization had started earlier, it was only in 1968 and its aftermath that French society became aware of the *permanent* presence of post-colonial immigrants. ‘1968’ was the opening of the Pandora’s box that contained the complex, explosive cluster of problems related to multicultural society. With their contradictory attitudes, the new left and the student movements in 1968 prefigured the failure of French society and the state in the decades to come, to engage with postcolonial immigrants as at once full and equal members of society and communities with distinct cultures and identities.” \citep[128]{bracke-2009}
\end{quote}

It was in this context that the 1969 “Statement of the Government of Canada on Indian policy” (known as the White Paper) was released. The White Paper called for the elimination of “Indian Status”, the abolition of the reserve system, and the cultural and economic assimilation of Indigenous peoples. In the context of late-1960s post-colonial politics, the White Paper drew widespread condemnation and was withdrawn in 1970. What replaced the assimilationist policy of the Canadian Government, according to Glen Sean Coulthard, was a “politics of recognition” enshrined in the Calder v. British Columbia case of 1973. Calder v. British Columbia was a Supreme Court case which recognized for the first time aboriginal title to land prior to colonization. The case had a profound effect on Indigenous land claims and marked a watershed moment in the development of “recognition” as a mechanism within Canadian politics (\citep[37]{Wrightson2017}). 

Additionally, in 1969 and 1971 Pierre Elliot Trudeau announced multiculturalism and bilingualism as the official policy of the Canadian government, mainly as an attempt to respond to increasing tensions between English and French Canada in the wake of the Quiet Revolution (\citep{Belanger2000, Maclure2005}. Opposition to this shift in the Canadian media in the 1970s had, by the 1990s, turned into “strong opposition to multiculturalism in certain quarters of the public and political spheres, and the drastic shrinking of bureaucratic structures devoted to it” (\citep[440]{karim2002}). Given a new round of Indigenous resurgence and Quebec nationalism in the first half of the 1990s, the work on the politics of recognition in that period (e.g. \cite{Taylor1992, kymlicka-1995, tully-strange}) was an attempt to save or recuperate the idea of multiculturalism, to put it on a firm philosophical and political foundation.

[Expand on this and make it clearer for non-Canadians]

Following the patriation of the Canadian Constitution in 1982, a round of (failed) constitutional amendments were proposed, the most contentious of which was the recognition of Quebec as a “distinct society”. In 1985, the Canadian Government passed the Multiculturalism Act, which enshrined the politics of recognition as it applied to “multicultural heritage” and the “rights of aboriginal peoples of Canada”, and struck the Meech Lake (constitutional) Accord in 1987. The Meech Lake Accord would have recognized the “distinct character” of Quebec (and convinced the province to ratify the 1982 province), but was defeated in 1990 when Oji-Cree Member of the Legislative Assembly in Manitoba Elijah Harper raised an eagle feather to indicate his dissent from the Accord, due to the lack of consultation with Indigenous peoples. The defeat of the Meech Lake Accord exposes the tensions within Canadian politics between a hegemonic settler-colonial state, the sovereignty of Indigenous peoples, and the separatist tendencies of English-French relations. Quebec resentment and the lack of Indigenous consultation led directly to both the 1990 Kanehsatà:ke Mohawk resistance and the failed Quebec referendum on Independence in 1995. The political theory of recognition, then, attempted to make sense of settler-colonial relationships both with Indigenous peoples and within the multiculturalism of the settler-colonial powers themselves. With respect to both Indigenous and Quebecois sovereignty, part of the issue rested on the question whether Canada was a “multicultural” society - thereby reducing Indigenous and Quebecois social formations as solely “cultural” - or whether it was “multinational”, and perhaps most importantly whether Canada could accommodate not only cultural and national diversity, but diversity in the mode of production (a challenge posed by Indigenous sovereignty and land claims). The politics of recognition was in one sense proposed to uphold minority collective or group rights, but in other sense attempted to restrict diversity to the cultural sphere (hence the focus on “multiculturalism” over “multinationalism” and the explicit limiting of diversity to “cultural diversity” and “cultural recognition” in Kymlicka and Tully). In other words, as Coulthard points out, the politics of recognition was intended to save multiculturalism while removing the threat of multinationalism (or alternative modes of production), that is - to use Nancy Fraser’s terms - to engage with affirmative vs. transformational modes of social justice (i.e. recognition, but not redistribution) \citep[35-36]{Coulthard2014}, \citep[74]{fraser-honneth}.
In the early to mid 1990s, coming out of the communitarian/liberalism debates of the 1980s,  concerns around what Charles Taylor called the “narcissism” of individualistic neoliberalism provoked a constellation of responses. The  development of communitarian liberalism sought to critique the individualism of classical liberalism and to reinstate a notion of collective responsibility, for example in Taylor’s work on the sources of modern individualism and the role it played in modern society (\cite{taylor-1989, Taylor-1991}). The work done by Will Kymlicka, Charles Taylor, and others to challenge the dominant ways of understanding multiculturalism and minority rights (\cite{kymlicka-citizenship, taylor-1992, honneth-1995, fraser-1997}), as well as the work done by James Tully on constitutionalism and diversity \citep{tully-1995}, sought - explicitly or not - to provide a philosophically grounded political theory to support federal government policy. All of this work not only engaged with the changed nature of multicultural and multinational nation states after the neoliberal turn, but also with the rise of identity-based social movements in the 1960s (and most especially after 1968), and with the end of the threat posed by the Eastern bloc countries which had been conceived as anti-individualistic challengers to liberal individual rights. The collapse of the Soviet Union opened up space for a collectivist critique of the individualism unleashed by neoliberal politics and economics, especially in the acquisitive 1980s. Furthermore, in the Canadian context, renewed Indigenous and Quebecois resistance to Canadian assimilation - the Kanehsatà:ke uprising in 1990 and the referendum on Quebecois independence in 1995 - for example, brought issues of assimilation vs. respect for minority rights very much to the forefront of Canadian cultural and political debates. The work of Kymlicka, Taylor, Tully, and others was an attempt to deal with the new realities of a unipolar, post-colonial, multiethnic and multinational polity. What they had in common was an attempt to update liberal theory to account for the post-welfare state realities of neoliberalism.

\section*{Introduction}

Contemporary liberal thought shares with computer programming an artificial distinction between algorithm and data, form and content, a “value-neutral” instrumental view of social life, and one which takes seriously the normative, moral, and ethical content of living itself. The inability or unwillingness to overcome this false binary lies at the heart of technology company’s inability to deal adequately with fake news, propaganda, or racism on their platforms: the algorithms are pure mathematics; their content is due to the ugliness of human life which has nothing to do with the algorithms. The dominant conceptions of liberal democratic institutions is eerily similar: due process and the rule of law function abstractly, and work properly as long as they are not harnessed to any particular normative goal. This shared logic of abstract proceduralism is not accidental, but exposes a deep connection between liberal political theory and the technological developments of late capitalism. Much has been written recently on both the dystopic and utopic aspects of contemporary technology, but less has been done to connect the underlying logics of liberalism with the functioning of technology itself.


In “The Politics of Recognition”, Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor draws on Ronald Dworkin’s essay on liberalism to distinguish between a “procedural” and a “substantive” form of liberalism. Procedural liberalism describes a society that “adopts no particular substantive view about the ends of life” but is rather “united around a strong procedural commitment to treat people with equal respect” \cite[56]{Taylor1994}: “A liberal society must remain neutral on the good life, and restrict itself to ensuring that however they see things, citizens deal fairly with each other and the state deals equally with all” \citep[57]{Taylor1994}. As is typical of Taylor’s idealism, this conception of the liberal proceduralism is disconnected from the material reality of the changing moments of capitalism. In the current world of “cybernetic” or “algorithmic” capitalism \citep{DyerWitheford2015, Parisi2015}, for example, liberal proceduralism is not independent of developments in computing, data, and surveillance that make up what Gilles Deleuze has called the “societies of control” \citep{Deleuze1992}. For Deleuze, “types of machines are easily matched with each type of society - not that machines are determining, but because they express those social forms capable of generating them and using them” \citep[6]{Deleuze1992}, and he identifies the development of the computer with the passage from the society of discipline to the society of control. Deleuze comes close to Marx’s description in \emph{The Poverty of Philosophy} of the way in which “in acquiring new productive forces men change their mode of production” such that “the hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill, society with the industrial capitalist” \citep[95]{Marx1955}. But Deleuze avoids the determinism that this passage is often called upon to support by focusing on the political dynamics surrounding technological change, the transition from a society in which the individual confronts the mass to one which in which “individuals have become ‘dividuals,’ and masses, samples, data, markets, or ‘banks’” \citep[5]{Deleuze1992}. In this network of decentralized control or “machinic  subjection” \citep{Lazzarato2012}, Marx’s vision of an automated capitalism comes to pass: “Once adopted into the production process of capital, the means of labour passes through different metamorphoses, whose culmination is the machine, or rather, an automatic system of machinery… set in motion by an automaton, a moving power that moves itself; this automaton consisting of numerous mechanical and intellectual organs, so that the workers themselves are cast merely as its conscious linkages” \citep[692]{Marx1973}. Much attention has been paid recently to the quantification of the self \citep{Moore2017}, the data mining of “platform capitalism” \citep{Srnicek2016} and the development of a data-driven “surveillance capitalism” \citep{Zuboff2019}, but what I want to focus on here is the relationship between algorithmic capitalism and the liberal proceduralism described by Taylor, and to contrast both with the “absolute procedure” Antonio Negri identifies as a core element of radically democratic constituent power. 
	
The neoliberal transition that began in the early 1980s capitalized on the demands made by the generation of 1968 against the post-war consensus (social peace, respect for established institutions, repression of individual desire) to reinscribing an absolute individualism (in the figure of the consumer and the entrepreneur) at the heart of political theory. John Rawls’ Theory of Justice set the tone by supposing that “each individual has a rational plan of life drawn up subject to the conditions that confront him. This plan is designed to permit the harmonious satisfaction of his interests” \citep[93]{Rawls2005} and argued that the role of liberal democratic institutions was to provide the neutral foundation for each individual to achieve their plan. However, the development of post-colonialism, Indigenous sovereignty, multiculturalism, and new social movements in the 1970s forced liberal theory to come to terms with questions of identity and community far from Rawls’ individualist “original position”. As Will Kymlicka put it in a 1989 article on “Liberal Individualism and Liberal Neutrality”, “one of the most persistent criticisms of Rawls theory of justice is that it is excessively individualistic, neglecting the way that individual values are formed in social contexts and pursued through communal attachments” \citep{Kymlicka1989b}. The liberal-communitarian debate (really a debate within liberalism) attempted to import some of the lessons of Marxism, feminism, and various postmodernisms around identity and collectivity, but without jettisoning what was most characteristic of liberalism. Ronald Dworkin, in contrasting a “value-neutral” theory of equality - issuing directly from Rawls’ understanding of individual rational plans of life - to a content-rich theory which included collective conceptions of the good, argued that it was precisely the neutrality of the liberal state towards any individual conception of the good that best protected individual rights and supported individual flourishing. Michael Sandel perceived the threat of this content-free neutrality in the rise of the procedural republic in which the alienation and isolation inherent in capitalist social relations were deeply inscribed within the state administration. Charles Taylor, in his investigation of Canadian multiculturalism, sought to balance the communitarianism advocated by Sandel with the respect for individual rights in a kind of “moderate proceduralism”. As recent work such as Alan Patten’s Equal Recognition has indicated \citep[patten-2014], the question of how to balance individualism with collective demands still hangs over liberal political thought.
	
For Antonio Negri, this question is unresolvable precisely because of the ways in which liberal institutions become static and closed. The algorithmic governmentality that is the end result of the procedural republic - made possible by the rapid development of ICTs and the availability of Big Data - is simply the latest example of the constituted power of capital and the state shutting down the democratic strength of the multitude. In this paper I will investigate Dworkin, Sandel, and Taylor’s attempts to clarify the the positions of the individual and the collective in liberal theory, before turning to Negri’s conception of constituent power.

	

\section*{Form, Content, and Procedure}


In his 1978 paper on liberalism, Ronald Dworkin´ sought to account for the dissolution of a “substantive” or “constitutive” agreement on what liberalism is. With the turn to neoliberalism, not only had liberalism become less clearly distinguishable from conservatism, but significant enough disagreements within liberalism led to an inability to agree on in its basic propositions. Given that different people can and do have different (substantive) opinions on what the good life consists in, Dworkin asks what it must mean for a government to treat its citizens as equals. The two possible answers Dworkin discusses are 1) that equality consists in the state remaining neutral with respect to any particular conception of the good life or 2) that this neutrality is impossible because the state “cannot treat its citizens as equal human beings without a theory of what human beings ought to be” \citep[127]{Dworkin1978}. These two opposing perspectives lie at the heart of many current social and political controversies, including the “free speech crisis” on North American campuses \citep{Mackinnon2018}, the risk that extending legal protection to transgender people further implicates them in structures of administrative discipline and oppression \citep{Spade2015}, and the BlackLivesMatter movement against police brutality and systemic racism. The non-liberal left tends to argue for the second theory of equality: that substantive difference must be recognized and accounted for, while both liberal and conservative positions tend to focus on the content-neutral (“colour-blind”) and procedural theory of equality.
	
For Dworkin, the first theory of equality is the one that leads to what are usually considered liberal values and political positions. The neutrality of the state with respect to any particular conception of the good prioritizes the content-neutral application of procedures to guarantee fair and equal distribution (of material good but also of opportunities):
	
\begin{quote}
Political democracy distributes opportunities, through the provisions of the civil and criminal law, as the citizens of a virtuous society wish it to be distributed, and that process will provide more scope for virtuous activity and less for vice than any less democratic technique. Democracy has a further advantage, moreover, that no other technique could have. It allows the community to use the processes of legislation to reaffirm, as a community, its public conception of virtue. \cite[137]{Dworkin1978}
\end{quote}

The two theories of equality Dworkin describes distinguish between an equality of content and an equality of form. The form/content distinction has been a philosophical problem going back to Plato and Aristotle, and is connected in Hegel’s logic, to the problem of Existence and Appearance. Rather than being binary oppositions, Hegel’s dialectical approach unites form and content into an essential reaction: “Appearance is the dialectic of Form \&amp; Content, or to put it another way, Form \&amp; Content is the ‘essence of appearance’. It is bourgeois philosophy that divides form from content, in order for bourgeois science to operate on the form without having to worry about the content (we can see this in the description of mathematics as concerned purely with formal systems or “formalisms”). To make reality tractable to (bourgeois) science and logic, form must be severed from content, made computable through the application of algorithms \footnote{we might usefully bear in mind the “scientific management” of Taylorism’s time-motion studies}. Alan Turing, in his 1936 paper on computation, distinguished between the mechanical capacity of a machine to calculate or compute, as opposed to  human means: “We may compare a man in the process of computing a real number to a machine which is only capable of a finite number of conditions” \citep[231]{Turing1936} through which it must pass in order to calculate, step-by-step, a final result. The automated machine which can perform such a computation work on formal procedures, including numbers, without consideration of their content. Computability, Turing notes, is equivalent to Alonzo Church’s “effective calculability”, both of which differ from the intuitive and imaginative ability of the human mind to compute. The mind engaged in calculation does not separate form and content, it is not engaged in pure “symbol manipulation”, but engages with both the formal processes and the semantic content in the process of thought itself.
	 	
The desire to reduce social and political questions to formal ones goes back at least to Hobbes if not to Plato, and Dworkin’s content-free proceduralism belongs to that genealogy, but the algorithmic ordering of social, economic, and political processes in order to reduce risk and guarantee outcomes (if not the good life, then at least higher profits) has only become possible with the advent of new technologies, greater storage and memory capacities, and the developments of faster and more sophisticated algorithms, such as those employed in machine learning and other artificial intelligence or Big Data processes. Moore’s Law - that computation power doubles roughly every two years - keeps the dream of an algorithmic discipline of society alive. Liberal proceduralism is the reflection of that dream. In his 2019 book on algorithmic governance, Ignas Kalpokas describes the ways in which digital data which works by establishing positivist correlations rather than meaningful causes and effects, “can be subsequently worked on and turned into algorithmically devised courses of action, changes in the digital architecture of our everyday environment, or nudging strategies”. Echoing Marx, Kalpokas notes that “this attitude that prides itself on replacing causes with trends also has the effect of altering the place of human persons, effectively objectifying and commodifying them, turning them into data generators where the data footprint is all that matters and is taken for the person” \citep[2]{Kalpokas2019}. Statistical prediction \citep{Joque2019} and behavioural economics (i.e. “nudging”) \citep{Bacevic2020}) have become extremely important in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, but they simply extend a much older logic of instrumental rationality and social control in political thought. 
	

\section*{Sandel’s “Procedural Republic”}

The proceduralism vision of liberal society espoused by Dworkin was taken up by Michael Sandel in his 1984 paper on “The Procedural Republic and the Unencumbered Self”. Sandel’s article was an intervention into the liberal-communitarian debate which arose in the wake of John Rawls’ Theory of Justice (1971), objecting to that work’s “unencumbered invidualism” in a context of post-colonial immigration and multiculturalism, settler-colonial multinationality, and the new social movements that came out of the Civil Rights Movement and the upheavals of 1968. For Sandel, liberal proceduralism is inextricably linked to various conceptions of individual selfhood, in the first place the Kantian transcendental subject, which Sandel finds unconvincing: “Kant’s idealist metaphysic, for all its moral and political advantage, cedes too much to the transcendent, and wins for justice its primacy only by denying it its human situation” \citep[85]{Sandel1984}. Sandel turns instead to look to an “unencumbered self” implied by Rawls’ original position, for whom “not the ends we choose but our capacity to choose them” is most important, “most essential to our personhood” \citep[86]{Sandel1984}. This individualism imagines a purely free subject capable of purely free choice. “Only if my identity is never tied to the aims and interests I may have at any moment,” Sandel writes, “can I think of myself as a free and independent agent, capable of choice” \citep[86]{Sandel1984}. Thus, while

\begin{quote}

As unencumbered selves, we are of course free to join in voluntary association with others, and so are capable of community in the cooperative sense. What is denied to the unencumbered self is the possibility of membership in any community bound by moral ties antecedent to choice; he cannot belong to any community where the self itself could be at stake. \cite[86-87]{Sandel1984}

\end{quote}

The “unencumbered” individualism that informs Rawls’ vision ends up being no more convincing than the Kantian transcendental subject. The critique of this individualism goes back to Marx’s critique of Proudhon and the classical political economists, notably in The Poverty of Philosophy and in the 1857 Introduction to the \emph{Grundrisse}. Where Marx and later social constructionists argue that the unencumbered self is a social impossibility (“Production by an isolated individual outside society… is as much of an absurdity as is the development of language without individuals living together and talking to each other” \cite[17]{Marx1973} - verify page), Sandel makes the weaker claim of undesirability:

\begin{quote}

To imagine a person incapable of constitutive attachments such as these is not to conceive an ideally free and rational agent, but to imagine a person wholly without character, without moral depth. For to have character is to know that I move in a history I neither summon nor command, which carries consequences nonetheless for my choices and conduct. It draws me closer to some and more distant from others; it makes some aims more appropriate, others less so. As a self-interpreting being, I am able to reflect on my history and in this sense to distance myself from it, but the distance is always precarious and provisional, the point of reflection never finally secured outside the history itself. But the liberal ethic puts the self beyond the reach of its experience, beyond deliberation and reflection. Denied the expansive self-understandings that could shape a common life, the liberal self is left to lurch between detachment on the one hand, and entanglement on the other. Such is the fate of the unencumbered self, and its liberating promise. \citep[90-91]{Sandel1984}

\end{quote}

Writing in the early 1980s, Sandel is unable to see what has become clear in hindsight: the dismantling of the Welfare State and the neoliberal instrumentalization of politics that Foucault called “governmentality”. Sandel glimpses the problem, but his vision of 1980s America as continuous with, rather than ruptured from, the US of the New Deal and the Great Society makes him unable to fully understand the problem: 

\begin{quote}

Notwithstanding the extension of the franchise and the expansion on individual rights and entitlements in recent decades, there is a widespread sense that, individually and collectively, our control over the forces that govern our lives is receding rather than increasing. This sense is deepened by what appear simultaneously as the power and the powerlessness of the nation-state. One [sic] the one hand, increasing numbers of citizens view the state as an overly intrusive presence, more likely to frustrate their purposes than advance them. And yet, despite its unprecedented role in the economy and society, the modern state seems itself disempowered, unable effectively to control the domestic economy, to respond to persisting social ills, or to work America’s will in the world. \citep[92]{Sandel1984}.

\end{quote}

In hindsight, we can recognize the “procedural republic” identified by Sandel more precisely as the “algorithmic republic” of computer-driven neoliberal social, political, and financial logics. Sandel’s misidentification of what was going on makes him see the problem with the procedural republic as the anti-liberal one of the concentration of power: “liberty in the procedural republic is defined in opposition to democracy, as an individual’s guarantee against what the majority might will. I am free insofar as I am the bearer of rights, where rights are trumps. Unlike the liberty of the early republic, the modern version permits - in fact even requires - concentrated power. This has to do with the universalizing logic of rights. Insofar as I have a right, whether to free speech or a minimum income, its provision cannot be left to the vagaries of local preferences but must be assured at the most comprehensive level of political association. It cannot be one thing in New York and another in Alabama.” \cite[93-95]{Sandel1984}. This universalization, however, is not a function of the concentration of power in human hands, but the making tractable, making computable, making predictable the unruly, messy data of human life for algorithmic procedure. Sandel misrecognizes the formalist imperative in algorithmic capitalism and neoliberal governmentality. When Sandel argues that “in our public life, we are more entangles, but less attached, than ever before” and that “it is as though the unencumbered self presupposed by the liberal ethic had begun to come true - less liberated than disempowered, entangled in a network of obligations and involvements unassociated with any act of will”, he, like Dworkin, does not understand that this is not a mistake or an aberration, but a reflection of the real socio-economic developments of post-welfare State capitalism. Where Dworkin divides theories of equality along form/content lines - thus inscribing the mathematical formalism of computability into his political theory - Sandel sees the statistical flattening of individual social relations and histories as an authoritarian tendency at odds with the liberal tradition.  Neither Dworkin’s nor Sandel’s liberal theory can comprehend the ways in which liberal thought as such is subject to capitalist (technical/instrumental) logics and capitalist restructuring. Sandel’s aporia arises from his identification of individualistic liberalism - which in principle should be opposed to the concentration of power - and democracy, rather than seeing liberalism as the hegemonic ideology of of capital itself. 


\section*{Charles Taylor and the Politics of Recognition}

Charles Taylor, in his investigations of multiculturalism and cultural difference, follows Sandel in his recognition that the pure individualism of Rawls - enshrined in the primacy of individual rights - would, in a fully developed procedural republic, lead to the erasure of all difference. But Taylor believes that, far from being completely antagonistic, a society based on Dworkin’s first theory of equality (which, for Taylor, means English Canada) can work out a liberal coexistence with a society based on the second (in Taylor’s view, Quebec). In this sense, then, the Taylor tries to reconcile the individualistic-communitarian contradiction, as well as Dworkin’s form/content antinomy \footnote{like Will Kymlicka, Taylor argues that some individual rights must be sacrosanct, while others can be balanced against communal needs. For Kymlicka (1995) polyethnic multiculturalism (i.e. of immigrant groups) would be able to be accommodated, while multinational multiculturalism (like Quebecois or Indigenous sovereignty) would not}.
	
Taylor believes that the flattening out of the procedural republic, the making uniform of the richness of life to make it tractable to algorithmic capital, can simply be resisted by the application of the correct constitutional theory. Such a theory would mix Dworkin’s two theories of equality. Thus, while in such a society “there would be no question of cultural differences determining the application of habeas corpus, for example”, a “broad range of immunities and presumptions of uniform treatment that have sprung up in modern cultures” \citep[61]{Taylor1994}. Resistance to the flattening-out uniformity of neoliberalism would simply be a matter of “weigh[ing] the importance of certain forms of uniform treatment against the importance of cultural survival, and opt sometimes in favour of the latter”. The existence of multiculturalism in a post-neoliberal conjuncture indicates, for Taylor, that “the rigidities of procedural liberalism may rapidly become impractical” \citep[61]{Taylor1994}. However, what we are seeing today - for example in the rapid development of facial recognition artificial intelligence technology in conjunction with the demands for a content-specific equality on the part of people of colour - is that the algorithmic republic meets the threat posed by difference with more computation, more statistical probability, more prediction. As a result, demands for the protection of difference leads to yet more uniformity and the inscription of marginalized subjects deeper and deeper into an algorithmically administrative structure of laws and the police. The combination of trans rights and prison abolitionism in, for example, the work of Dean Spade, indicates the fundamental incompatibility of difference with state administrative institutions. The politics of recognition held out by Taylor is proving (has proven) to be inadequate to the contradiction between difference and computability, content and form, which lies at the heart of the attempts - by Dworkin, Sandel, Taylor, and many others - to salvage liberal theory in the face of rapidly worsening capitalist crisis. We must look elsewhere for a theory of society and power which might overcome the false dichotomy, the binary logics, of capitalist technology reflected in liberal thought. 


\section*{Constituent Power as “Absolute Procedure”}

In the earliest days of the rapid expansion of information and communications technologies (ICTs), Antonio Negri saw them as holding a communicative and collaborative potential to adapt to the neoliberal expansion of the subsumption of labour under capital. The development of ICTs, he argued, was critical to the movement from the mass to the socialized worker. Drawing on the tension identified by Italian workerists and autonomists between capital’s need to foster increased collaboration and cooperative work, and the radical effects this cooperation had on worker solidarity and directed action, Negri saw the development of technology under neoliberalism as at the same time erasing and flattening out difference and as providing the basis for “a new class composition and a new political subject” \citep[48]{Negri1989}. Negri saw the reality of the neoliberal transition and the necessary response more clearly than Dworkin, Sandel, or Taylor, and while his utopian view of the potential of ICTs has often been dismissed, along with the theory of “cognitive capitalism” as naive “accelerationism”, the political theory that derived from his understanding of neoliberalism and technology more sophisticated than that, and is important to the question of identity and communal society. 
	
The uniformity Dworkin, Sandel, and Taylor saw darkly Negri recognized as a situation in which “production and reproduction constitute a completely uniform, undifferentiated network” \citep[89]{Negri1989}. The technological advances of neoliberalism depended on the flattening-out, the making average, of the workforce \footnote{Thus fulfilling Marx’s analytical insight that the labour is valued as a social average}: “Society thus offers itself to work in the same way that, in the factory, a single machine, several machines, and the entire system of machinery offered themselves to the labour force: namely, as a system of preconditions… The machines constitute a system because this world of technical conditions is an ordered universe and a sort of ideal schema to which new activity can and must be added” \citep[90]{Negri1989}. This ordered universe is the only kind in which algorithms can predict correctly and avoid risk. For Negri, this ordering has severe repercussions for Marx’s theory of value (though Negri’s interpretation of the labour theory of value under neoliberalism has been contested, for example in \cite{caffentzis-letters}). The flattening out of difference by algorithmic capital is part of the machinic ecology of contemporary capitalism, and cannot be reformed by tweaking liberal political theory. Rather, the insistence on difference, for Negri, lies at the heart of the class struggle: “diversity and antagonism represent a choice in favour of the values of life and the quality of reproduction, and a rejection of negative values, of the practices of death and the nullifying tendencies that are implicit in the capitalist machine” \citep[94]{Negri1989}.
	
Where the procedural republic was, for Sandel, a violation of the principles of liberal communitarianism, Negri sees it as the culmination of the process of subsumption from the factory to society, of the transformation of the mass workers into the socialized worker, with which liberal thought has been complicit. The institutions that Dworkin and Taylor in particular look to to salvage liberal individualism are already compromised, in Negri’s view, because they, like the factory and like capital itself, form the constituted power that is by definition antagonistic to any of what Sandel calls the “constitutive attachments” that make life worth living. Indeed, the distinction drawn by Dworkin between two antagonistic theories of equality, a distinction Sandel and Taylor can only moderate but not overcome, only makes sense within the context of the constituted power of liberal politics (law, rights, representative democracy, elections etc). For Negri, the choice is a false one, as is the antagonism between individual and collective life that is another obstacle for Sandel, which Taylor seeks to overcome in his politics of recognition. 
	
For Negri, the contradiction between the irreducible differences and rich constitutive attachments of human life on the one hand and the constitution of an ordered society on the other is a problem the political theory tries in vain to resolve. Because constitutional theory derives its legitimacy from “the people”, it always needs to find a way to limit or put an end to the constitution-forming activity of the multitude. Once the people (in the form, say, of a constituent assembly) has done its work and a new juridical and political order has been constituted, it must then be disbanded and its power made subject to the legal order it has legitimated. The question for traditional political theory, as Negri conceives it, is as follows: 
	
	\begin{quote}
	How can we keep open the source of the vitality of the system while controlling it? Constitutuent power must somehow be maintained in order to avoid the possibility that its elimination might nullify the very meaning of the juridical system and the democratic relation that must characterize its horizon. \cite[4]{Negri1999}.
	\end{quote}

If the constituted order - including the procedural republic - owes its legitimacy to “the power of the people”, then that power cannot merely be dispensed with once the legal-political institutions are in place. It must be maintained somehow, even if only discursively, as a source of legitimacy of the system itself. However, the constituted power of political institutions must always try to overcome or neutralize the threat posed by constituent power itself. As Negri puts it, “the relationship that juridical theory (and through it the constituted arrangement) wants to impose on constituent power works in the direction of neutralization, mystification, or, really, the attribution of senselessness” \cite[10]{Negri1999}. If we equate Dworkin’s second theory of equality, in which the government holds to a substantive vision of the good, then we might be tempted to argue that the procedural theory is the theory of constituted power, and the substantive theory that of constituent power. But Negri refuses this false dichotomy completely: Dworkin’s model assumes a division between constituted and constituent power in both theories of equality. The government is divided from the people (despite owing its legitimacy to the people), the government is an administrative apparatus rather than the expression of the collective decision of the multitude as such. Negri’s vision of constituent power is that of an absolute democracy, and democracy as an absolute power.
	
Procedural liberalism, especially in its current, algorithmic form, seeks to replace the absolute democratic power of the multitude by the once-and-for-all rules of algorithmic logic. It seeks to institute the strength of the multitude in process and the rule of law that are decided on and then obeyed. For Negri, however, 
	
	\begin{quote}
	at the very moment when strength gets instituted it ceases being strength and thus declares itself as never having been such. There is only one correct (and paradoxical) condition for a definition of sovereignty linked to that of constituent power: that it exists as the praxis of a constitutive act, renewed in freedom, organized in the continuity of a free praxis. But this contradicts the entire tradition of the concept of sovereignty and all its possible meanings. Consequently, the concept of sovereignty and that of constitutive power stand in absolute opposition. \cite[22]{Negri1999}
	\end{quote}

The “constitutive attachments” which Sandel sees threatened by the procedural republic are, in Negri’s view, never truly threatened, precisely because real strength derives from the multitude. Constituent power does not seek institutionalization, but seeks only “more being - ethical being, social being, community”, and it is in this way that constituent power is the real form of democracy. This resistance to institutionalization means that all the rules, procedures, algorithms, and processes of constituted power (of the state, of capital, of capitalist technology) can never dominate over the ongoing decision-making of the multitude. Those rules, procedures, etc, are there to avoid decision-making, to remove decision from the ambit of the multitude and to place it within the static confines of constituted power.
	
This power of collective, open-ended decision-making Negri calls “absolute procedure”, the production of the forms-of-life that make community and communal being possible: “The political is here production, production par excellence, collective and non-teleological” \citep[27]{Negri1999}.
	
For Negri, the past participle (“constituted”) indicates a final closure of the constituent power of the multitude. It is in this respect that “absolute procedure” differs from liberal proceduralism - the constituent procedure is absolute because it is unfinalized and unfinalizable, while liberal procedure is closed and finds its perfection in static form of the algorithm. The trade off of the perpetual openness of constituent power is risk, risk that is intolerable to the capitalist quest for growth and profit: “The constituent principle is not a dialectical principle - it cannot be resolved or overcome - but this quality itself keeps it in a terribly precarious state” \citep[60]{Negri1999}. The ongoing crisis of constituent power is the tendency to constitutedness, to finalization, institutionalization, algorithmization: “the constituent power and strength are in fact absolute, but any actualization opposes them, wants to deny their absoluteness. If the absolute overflows or dislocates, it finds itself confronted by the rigidity of the constituted” \citep[60]{Negri1999}. 
	
The neverending process of exercising strength and making decisions is, however, the heart of democracy for Negri. Paradoxically, therefore, it is constituent power rather than liberalism that can guarantee the equal treatment of difference; not a value-free or content-neutral equality, but an equality that sees difference as richness. Difference is a valued production of the multitude, rather than a deviation to be stamped out in the name of uniformity, or to be vaguely tolerated as long as it poses no threat to liberal procedure and individual rights. Thus, as Negri remarks, “absoluteness never becomes totalitarianism”, the strength of both individuals and the collective “is expressed and nourished by discord and struggle… and the construction of the political is the product of permanent innovation” \citep[29]{Negri1999}. The algorithm - the procedures of the liberal republic - represent closures, the shutting down of individual agency and collective power. Constituent power is, on the contrary, always open: “it is at the same time resistance to oppression and construction of community; it is political discussion and tolerance; it is popular armament and the affirmation of principles through democratic invention” \cite[29]{Negri1999}.
	
Negri thus rejection the opposition between Dworkin’s two theories of equality, between Sandel’s procedural republic and the constitutive attachments of human life, between Taylor’s sacrosanct individual rights and the balance of communitarianism. These choices are false ones, set up by liberalism’s position as role mouthpiece of capitalist social, economic, political, and technological relationships. Every attempt to strike the “right” balance between competing worldviews, or between the individual and the collective, or between universalism and particularity, is doomed to fail precisely because they are conceived under the aspect of the constituted power of the capitalist state. If we reject this aspect, then those political problems fall away.


\section{Homoiconicity and the Imitation Game}

The traditional algorithms used in computer programming are seen as pure formalisms different from the data they operate on, with unchanging rules and orders of operation. They are closed, final, static, and run in a neutral fashion, irrespective of the semantic content of the data. In this, programming algorithms are mirrors of liberal procedures. However, if Turing in 1936 proposed a model for a universal machine that would operate properly on any instruction set, by 1950 he was developing a new model which treated form and content, algorithm and data, not as two isolated entities, but as a single changing process. For Turing, artificial intelligence in the form of learning machines exemplified, like Negri’s constituent power, an “absolute procedure”.
	
In the paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” which introduced the “imitation game” and set the stage for the artificial intelligence research of the later 1950s, Turing  argued against an algorithmic view of human behaviour: “It is not possible to produce a set of rules purporting to describe what a man should do in every conceivable set of circumstances” \citep[452]{Turing1950}. If machinery is to have the capacity of at least imitating human behaviour, the fixed, static nature of algorithms must be discarded, a process Turing equates with learning itself: 

\begin{quote}
The idea of a learning machine may appear paradoxical to some readers. How can the rules of operation of the machine change? hey should describe completely how the machine will react whatever its history might be, whatever changes it might undergo. The rules are thus quite time-invariant. This is quite true. The explanation of the paradox is that the rules which get changed in the learning process are of a rather less pretentious kind, claiming only an ephemeral validity.\cite[458]{Turing1950}
	\end{quote}

While Turing sees intelligent behaviour as consisting precisely in “a departure from the completely disciplined behaviour involved in computation”, he nonetheless sees this departure as only a very slight one. If we turn this process around, we could say that rather than a departure from the fixed order of a given algorithm, a departure from the existing rules, learning and intelligent behaviour is in fact a production of new rules, new algorithms. This is the central element in Negri’s idea of an absolute procedure, a procedure that is not bound by any existing rules, and which does not depart from rules but is constantly producing new rules. 
	
How does this changing of the rules/algorithm work, either for Turing or for Negri. The answer lies in not drawing any kind of distinction between form and content, code and data, political procedure and lived experience. In computer programming, the phenomenon of code and data being indistinguishable is called homoiconicity.
	
The LISP language (now family of languages) which was developed by John McCarthy in 1956 in the aftermath of Turing’s paper, exhibits homoiconicity: its code and its data take the same form. Code can be used as data and data can be used as code, with the result that a program can re-write itself, can change its own algorithm as it is running. If we have, on the one hand, a political theory that sees political procedure and the multitude as indistinguishable elements of a single political subject, and on the other hand, a technological model that overcomes the binary division between form and content, could we not ask what political situation would have to be the case for this polity and this technology to have the dominance that Silicon Valley and liberal proceduralism have now? Such a transcendental question might open new space for an exploration of a radical democratic mode of production. 

	
\section{Conclusion}

The distinction between procedure and content - the rule of law and lived experience - is a false one shared by both contemporary technology and liberal political thought. Computer programming and liberal theory are both reflections of real changes in the material relations of production dating back to the Second World War and achieving a particular dominance with the neoliberal transition. Attempts to reconcile procedure and content, in Taylor’s politics of recognition, for example, cannot be successful precisely because liberal thought reflects the realities of social relationships. The radical democracy of Negri’s constituent power, on the other hand, precisely because it is an “absolute procedure” intimately connected with the flourishing of the multitude, avoids the false distinction between juridical form and the content of life.</Text>

            <Text>In the period after Second World War and the move towards post-colonial politics, and especially after 1968, with the rise of identity-based social movements, the question of diversity came to the fore. Will Kymlicka, in his account of the development of minority rights in multicultural states, argued that an original view of culturally, ethnically, and linguistically homogeneous nations was the ideal model on which much of Western political theory has been based. Influenced by this perspective, governments have frequently followed policies designed to ensure or maintain the nation’s homogeneity. Mechanisms such as expulsion, extermination, assimilation, and segregation have all been leveraged in various attempts to maintain the unified homogeneity of the nation-state itself \cite{kymlicka-citizenship}. In the period following First World War, the “right to national self-determination” formulated by Woodrow Wilson was a touchstone for this question of multiethnic or multinational polities, but the unstable political system that resulted issued in the ethnic-cleansing and attempted unifications of Germany on the eve of the Second World War. 
In the post-war period, the concept of human rights took over from “national self-determination” as the dominant way of thinking about minority rights, multiculturalism, and multinational states. However, the very universality of human rights discourse tended to prevent the consideration of minority or community rights as such. This derives fundamentally from the “methodological individualism” that characterizes liberal political theory. Kymlicka writes that as long as individual rights were guaranteed, “no further rights needed to be attributed to the members of specific ethnic or national minorities” \cite{kymlicka-citizenship}. It is important to recognize that the universality of human rights was predicated on the individual application of those rights. </Text>

            <Text>Introduction: The Neoliberal Context of the Theory of Justice.

The Liberal-Communitarian Debate originated in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a reaction to both the radical individualism of John Rawls’ Theory of Justice (1971) and the individualistic, consumerist culture of neoliberalism of the 1970s (the “me decade” \citep{Wolfe1976}). Much of the work that contributed to this debate is striking for its abstraction, whether dealing with political philosophy or real constitutional questions, from social and historical context. Additionally, while the debate is framed as one between liberalism and communitarianism, it is in reality a debate within liberalism, countering a radical, Lockean individualism with an approach that tries to supplement or correct it by bringing social relations into the liberal ontology.
Despite, or perhaps because of, this abstraction, it is crucial to bear in mind the transition through which developed capitalism was passing in the late 1960s, i.e. the period in which Rawls wrote the Theory of Justice. Rawls attempts to develop a conception of “justice as fairness”, but this attempt is presented as an ahistorical and abstract investigation to which social developments are unimportant or irrelevant and historical/communal relationships actively harmful (i.e. the “veil of ignorance”). However, by placing Rawls’ theory of justice in its context, we can get a better sense of what the book was meant to achieve.
The 1960s were marked by radical change in society and politics, the most important of which were 1) post-colonialism (Suez, Kenya, Algeria, Vietnam) and attendant immigration from colonized to colonizing countries, resulting in an increase in polyethnic societies (Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech is 1968); 2) rejection of the post-war culture of social solidarity experienced as a repression of individuality (described by Herbert Marcuse in One-Dimensional Man [1964] and  Eros and Civilization [2nd Edition 1966]) and the development of a counter-culture, issuing in the worker-student revolts of 1968 but also the Woodstock and Altamont music festivals of 1969; and 3) the development of “new social movements”, inspired by the civil rights movement (Selma marches 1965), especially second-wave feminism, but also gay rights (Stonewall 1969) and anti-war movements (first Aldermaston march was 1958). It was in the context of these kinds of social pressures and demands that Rawls sought to construct a theory of justice adequate to the new conjuncture.

The neoliberal turn of the 1970s disposed of the post-war consensus which had papered over racial, gender, and class antagonisms in the name of social solidarity. By the late 1960s the question of ethnic minorities in particular returned with a vengeance, in the context of wars of liberation and decolonization more generally. The interwar period had seen the development of a system of bilateral treaties designed to protect ethnic minority rights and enable the the “national self-determination” enshrined in Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points within a system of multiethnic and multinational empires. As \cite[2]{kymlicka-1995} points out, by 1939 this system had become unworkable, and Hitler was able to justify the invasion of Poland and Czechoslovakia and the Austria anschluss on the basis of the self-determination of ethnic Germans (i.e. the “Heim ins Reich” policy). The anti-imperial struggles of the 1940s-1960s (India, Algeria, Kenya, Congo, etc) dovetailed with struggles for individual self-determination in the face of out-of-date establishment cultures in Europe and America. For example, the May 1968 uprisings in France were formed by a combination of new left-wing agitation (students in addition to workers), expressions of radical individual self-determination, and post-colonial immigrant experience, though the relationship between these three dynamics is not as simple as was once believed. As Maud Anne Bracke writes,
\begin{quote}
	“’1968’, this, meant France’s definite shift to postcoloniality. While de-colonization had started earlier, it was only in 1968 and its aftermath that French society became aware of the *permanent* presence of post-colonial immigrants. ‘1968’ was the opening of the Pandora’s box that contained the complex, explosive cluster of problems related to multicultural society. With their contradictory attitudes, the new left and the student movements in 1968 prefigured the failure of French society and the state in the decades to come, to engage with postcolonial immigrants as at once full and equal members of society and communities with distinct cultures and identities.” \citep[128]{bracke-2009}
\end{quote}

In Canada, the social transformations indicated above were joined by two specifically Canadian political issues. In 1969, an attempt by the federal government to introduce an explicit policy of assimilation of Indigenous peoples (the 1969 “White Paper”) was met with such resistance that the policy was abandoned in favour of a policy of “recognition” \citep{coulthard2014}. Nationwide organized Indigenous resistance developed in response to the White Paper, forcing the Canadian government to begin dealing with questions of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis sovereignty. Quebec sovereignty was also a pressing concern, with the 1970s bracketed by the “October crisis” of 1970 and the first Quebec referendum of 1980.

What is important to bear in mind is that these demands for recognition and justice were, in David Harvey’s view, used as justification for the implementation neoliberal policies, focusing on  individualist economic principles (both the individual consumer and the individual entrepreneur become significant figures in the 1970s): “The student movements that swept the world in 1968… were in part animated by the quest for greater freedoms of speech and of personal choice. More generally, these ideals appeal to anyone who values the ability to make decisions for themselves.” \citep[5]{harvey-2005}

Harvey goes on to argue that the explosion of the desire for individual freedom opened the door to neoliberal policies based on radical individualism and free-market fundamentalism, deregulation and privatization, summed up by Margaret Thatcher’s remark that “there’s no such thing as society, there are individual men and women and there are families”. As Stuart Hall remarked about this conjunctural shift, while “the Keynsian welfare state tried to set ‘the common good’ above profitability’, neoliberalism meant that ‘the function of the liberal state should be limited to safeguarding the the conditions in which profitable competition can be pursued without engendering Hobbes’ ‘war of all against all’” \citep[707]{hall-2011} ]

 Harvey argues that neoliberalism was the (successful) attempt made by capital to win back the share of profits given to labour as part of the post-war consensus \citep{harvey-2005}. The anti-establishment and in some senses anti-solidarity demands made by various new social identities in the 1960s were reframed as individual concerns (with individual solutions, i.e. consumption) in order to gain support for the neoliberal agenda. Foucault’s work in the late 1970s and early 1980s explores some of these consequences, from governmentality (essentially a consumerist conception of government) to the individual as entrepreneur (e.g. with education as “self-investment). Rawls’ theory of justice offers a radically individualist model of liberal social philosophy in opposition to both utilitarian and intuitionist conceptions of justice, both of which Rawls’ sees as (at least potentially) violating any individualist protection of justice and rights.
In the years following Rawls’ theory of justice, various critiques of his extreme individualism tried to find a balance between the individual and the various identity groups that had gained significant social and political power by the end of the 1960s. The construction of a liberal theory that would account for both individual rights and the kind of collective or communal demands made by “special interest groups” (the term was coined in 1961, albeit in the context of computing technology) would ensure liberal hegemony over the new conjuncture. The liberal-communitarian debate is therefore an attempt to find an adequate version of liberal political theory for the neoliberal period. This is not to suggest, however, that liberal political theorists were not engaged in a good faith attempt to deal with the changed social picture, but I follow Negri in seeing liberalism as the ideology of capital, and therefore as engaged in attempts to justify and legitimate a capitalist social order.

Characterizing the Liberal-Communitarian Debate

As we have seen, then, the liberal-communitarian debate took place against a backdrop of major social transformation in developed capitalist countries. Rawls’ reassertion of individualism was quickly seen as inadequate, which raised the question of the universality of rights and the question of collective identity that lay at the heart of the debate. In 1978, Ronald Dworkin attempted to shore up the individualist conception of rights and distribution by insisting on a “procedural” theory of equality and equal respect which would not only allow individuals to pursue their own vision of the good irrespective of social or institutional views (i.e. liberal society and the liberal state would remain neutral on such questions), but also ensure equal distribution (of rights, opportunities, and life-chances) irrespective of the identity, opinions, or orientations of any individual person \citep{Dworkin1978}. Michael Sandel, writing in 1984, challenged this individualist conception by arguing that Dworkin’s proceduralism, embodied in a “procedural republic” in fact exacerbated social isolation and alienation \citep{Sandel1984}. 
Theobald and Dinkelman, writing in 1995, summed up the liberal-communitarian debate as follows:
	\begin{quote}
	
	The chief criticism communitarians aim at the contemporary contours of liberalism is that they have allowed Lockean-inspired possessive individualism to create a cultural focus on the self as the predominant contributing force in identity formation. The emergence of this individualism has come at the expense of the roles hitherto played by factors outside the individual in shaping one’s sense of self. Most notable among these is the role played by community membership, but also important are external factors such as religious ties and connections to the earth. In short, Western liberal culture has produced individuals obsessed with themselves, or with their own rights… In the process… any meaningful sense of communal obligation, responsibility, and tradition has been lost or greatly diminished. \cite[2-3]{TheobaldDinkelman1995}.

	\end{quote}

The communitarian response to individualist liberalism can therefore be seen as a reaction to the corrosive individualism of the neoliberal turn. Having dismissed communal or collective (i.e. non-liberal) social theories such those associated with Marxism or feminism, liberalism had to try to find its own way to take social relationships and social construction seriously (at least in part) and to counter the “culture of narcissism” it recognized in the neoliberal culture of the 1970s and 1980s. Taylor doesn’t engage with Marxist thinkers in his work on communitarianism and recognition, and while Kymlicka does engage at length with “the Marxist critique of justice”, he fundamentally misreads the Marxist position as one which would dissolve any identity-defining social relationships rather than ones based on unequal relationships of power \cite[102]{Kymlicka1989} (this question anticipates the discussion of necessary, identity-forming, productive social relationships with respect to Negri). This reading of Marx stems, I think, from the fundamental assumption of isolated individualism (the “Robinsonades”) that seems to be a particular aporia in liberal thinking (Hegel critiqued this view in his pre-Phenomenology work, and Marx throughout his career, most clearly in The Poverty of Philosophy and in the 1857 “Introduction”).
	 Alasdair MacIntyre’s After Virtue (1981) and Sandel’s Liberalism and Limits of Justice (1982)  attempted to bring communal social relations into the individualist liberal social ontology. Macintyre called the culture of narcissism a “new dark ages” which required “local forms of community within which civility and intellectual and moral life can be sustained” \citep{Macintyre1981}. In his 1993 book, Communitarianism and its critics, Daniel Bell called the line taken by MacIntyre, Sandel, Taylor, and others, as the “communalization of liberalism”. This communalization was long overdue, given that Axel Honneth argued in his book on the politics of recognition that taking social and communal relationships seriously, as against a transcendent or absolute individualism, was precisely Hegel’s project in the early part of his career (the years before the publication of the Phenomenology of Spirit [1807]) \citep{honneth-struggle}. The reason for the delayed engagement with the question of community and “constitutive attachments” (Sandel) is that individualistic liberalism of the utilitarian or intuitionist variety had been adequate to the needs of capitalist society (i.e. its social and class relations) until the neoliberal turn in the early 1970s.

The Multicultural Context of Canadian Communitarianism

In Canada, the liberal-communitarian debate took a specific form in the context of Indigenous and Quebecois sovereignty and multiculturalism. On one side was the development of a “politics of recognition” in both a philosophical form \citep{Taylor1994} and a constitutional one \citep{tully-strange}; on the other side was an attempt by liberals like Will Kymlicka to include multinational and polyethnic multiculturalism into a liberal-individualist framework \citep{kymlicka-1995}. These debates over the political theory of recognition, minority, and group rights played a significant role in real political dynamics in Canada since the 1970s, but especially in the period of Indigenous resurgence and Quebec nationalism in the early to mid 1990s (i.e. after the failure of two rounds of constitutional reform). 

It was in this context that the 1969 “Statement of the Government of Canada on Indian policy” (known as the White Paper) was released. The White Paper called for the elimination of “Indian Status”, the abolition of the reserve system, and the cultural and economic assimilation of Indigenous peoples. In the context of late-1960s post-colonial politics, the White Paper drew widespread condemnation and was withdrawn in 1970. What replaced the assimilationist policy of the Canadian Government, according to Glen Sean Coulthard, was a “politics of recognition” enshrined in the Calder v. British Columbia case of 1973. Calder v. British Columbia was a Supreme Court case which recognized for the first time aboriginal title to land prior to colonization. The case had a profound effect on Indigenous land claims and marked a watershed moment in the development of “recognition” as a mechanism within Canadian politics (\citep[37]{Wrightson2017}). 

Additionally, in 1969 and 1971 Pierre Elliot Trudeau announced multiculturalism and bilingualism as the official policy of the Canadian government, mainly as an attempt to respond to increasing tensions between English and French Canada in the wake of the Quiet Revolution (\citep{Belanger2000, Maclure2005}. Opposition to this shift in the Canadian media in the 1970s had, by the 1990s, turned into “strong opposition to multiculturalism in certain quarters of the public and political spheres, and the drastic shrinking of bureaucratic structures devoted to it” (\citep[440]{karim2002}). Given a new round of Indigenous resurgence and Quebec nationalism in the first half of the 1990s, the work on the politics of recognition in that period (e.g. \cite{Taylor1992, kymlicka-1995, tully-strange}) was an attempt to save or recuperate the idea of multiculturalism, to put it on a firm philosophical and political foundation.

By the late 1970s, questions of multiculturalism, Quebec nationalism, and Indigenous sovereignty, as well as the Canada’s own desire for post-colonial sovereignty, led to the partition of the constitution from Great Britain in 1982 \footnote{The Canadian government had been trying to take control of the constitution since the 1920s}. The new constitution was essentially an amended British North America Act (1867), with defined provincial-federal division of powers, and the addition of a Charter of Rights and Freedoms proper to a liberal-democracy in a world defined by universal human rights. The new constitution was immediately contentious, in that it made little provision for Indigenous rights and none for Quebecois sovereignty (indeed, Quebec under the leadership of Rene Levesque felt betrayed by English Canada in the constitutional process; every subsequent round of constitutional reform has been an attempt to bring Quebec fully into the constitutional fold). 

Following the patriation of the Canadian Constitution in 1982, a round of (failed) constitutional amendments were proposed, the most contentious of which was the recognition of Quebec as a “distinct society”. In 1985, the Canadian Government passed the Multiculturalism Act, which enshrined the politics of recognition as it applied to “multicultural heritage” and the “rights of aboriginal peoples of Canada”, and struck the Meech Lake (constitutional) Accord in 1987. The Meech Lake Accord would have recognized the “distinct character” of Quebec (and convinced the province to ratify the 1982 province), but was defeated in 1990 when Oji-Cree Member of the Legislative Assembly in Manitoba Elijah Harper raised an eagle feather to indicate his dissent from the Accord, due to the lack of consultation with Indigenous peoples. The defeat of the Meech Lake Accord exposes the tensions within Canadian politics between a hegemonic settler-colonial state, the sovereignty of Indigenous peoples, and the separatist tendencies of English-French relations. Quebec resentment and the lack of Indigenous consultation led directly to both the 1990 Kanehsatà:ke Mohawk resistance and the failed Quebec referendum on Independence in 1995. The political theory of recognition, then, attempted to make sense of settler-colonial relationships both with Indigenous peoples and within the multiculturalism of the settler-colonial powers themselves. With respect to both Indigenous and Quebecois sovereignty, part of the issue rested on the question whether Canada was a “multicultural” society - thereby reducing Indigenous and Quebecois social formations as solely “cultural” - or whether it was “multinational”, and perhaps most importantly whether Canada could accommodate not only cultural and national diversity, but diversity in the mode of production (a challenge posed by Indigenous sovereignty and land claims). The politics of recognition was in one sense proposed to uphold minority collective or group rights, but in other sense attempted to restrict diversity to the cultural sphere (hence the focus on “multiculturalism” over “multinationalism” and the explicit limiting of diversity to “cultural diversity” and “cultural recognition” in Kymlicka and Tully). In other words, as Coulthard points out, the politics of recognition was intended to save multiculturalism while removing the threat of multinationalism (or alternative modes of production), that is - to use Nancy Fraser’s terms - to engage with affirmative vs. transformational modes of social justice (i.e. recognition, but not redistribution) \citep[35-36]{coulthard2014}, \citep[74]{fraser-honneth}.

Communitarianism and the Politics of Recognition

	In the early to mid 1990s, coming out of the communitarian/liberalism debates of the 1980s,  concerns around what Charles Taylor called the “narcissism” of individualistic neoliberalism provoked a constellation of responses. The  development of communitarian liberalism sought to critique the individualism of classical liberalism and to reinstate a notion of collective responsibility, for example in Taylor’s work on the sources of modern individualism and the role it played in modern society (\cite{Taylor1989, Taylor1991}). The work done by Will Kymlicka, Charles Taylor, and others to challenge the dominant ways of understanding multiculturalism and minority rights (\cite{kymlicka-1995, Taylor1994, honneth-struggle, Fraser1997}), as well as the work done by James Tully on constitutionalism and diversity \citep{tully-strange}, sought - explicitly or not - to provide a philosophically grounded political theory to support federal government policy. All of this work not only engaged with the changed nature of multicultural and multinational nation states after the neoliberal turn, but also with the rise of identity-based social movements in the 1960s (and most especially after 1968), and with the end of the threat posed by the Eastern bloc countries which had been conceived as anti-individualistic challengers to liberal individual rights. The collapse of the Soviet Union opened up space for a collectivist critique of the individualism unleashed by neoliberal politics and economics, especially in the acquisitive 1980s. Furthermore, in the Canadian context, renewed Indigenous and Quebecois resistance to Canadian assimilation - the Kanehsatà:ke uprising in 1990 and the referendum on Quebecois independence in 1995 - for example, brought issues of assimilation vs. respect for minority rights very much to the forefront of Canadian cultural and political debates. The work of Kymlicka, Taylor, Tully, and others was an attempt to deal with the new realities of a unipolar, post-colonial, multiethnic and multinational polity. What they had in common was an attempt to update liberal theory to account for the post-welfare state realities of neoliberalism.

The theory of the “politics of recognition” arose as a particular tendency out of the communitarian/liberalism debates of the 1980s. The turn to neoliberalism saw the beginnings of the dismantling of the Welfare State along with a decline in the social solidarity of the post-war consensus. This decline was in part caused by, in part opened the door to, expressions of individual desire and a rejection of communitarian compromise in the name of consumer choice on the one hand, and the radical rejection of the Establishment in the counterculture of the 1960s, whose most radical expression was in the worker and student revolts of 1968. This resurgent individualism was harnessed by neoliberal theorists in their push to implement free-market reforms and to drive individual consumerism as two of the main [drivers] of their political and economic theory \citep{harvey-2005}. The social and political effects of this transition are diagnosed by, for example, Marcuse, but also by Deleuze, Guattari, Derrida, and others: the shift to neoliberalism can, following Jameson, be understood as provoking a shift towards post-structuralism and other “postmodern” philosophical positions \citep{Jameson1991}. Justice - both individual and post-colonial - played a major role in the development of post-structuralist theory at the end of the 1960s. The editors of Deconstruction and the Possibility of Justice note that while “at least by its critics, deconstruction has been associated with cynicism towards the very idea of justice”, it is “in some way, aligned with the marginalized” \citep[ix]{CornellRosenfeldCarleson1992}.


In response to this, liberal theorists like John Rawls sought to restore liberalism’s primacy in questions of justice and political philosophy, with Rawls’ Theory of Justice (1971) “reinvigorat[ing] ‘high liberalism’ \citep[3]{Galisanka2019} for the neoliberal turn. By the end of the 1970s, however, as neoliberalism had led not only to the political projects of Thatcher, Reagan, and others, a reinvigoration not just of liberalism, but libertarianism, had developed. Robert Nozick’s Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974) directly challenged Rawls’ conception of the role of the state in the distribution of justice, and argued. Connecting Nozick’s individualist libertarianism and a “methodological individualism” present in Rawls’ Theory with the effects of the neoliberal dismantling of the Welfare State, especially after the elections of Thatcher (1979) and Reagan (1980), many political philosophers such as Michael Sandel, Michael Walzer, Alistair McIntyre, and  Charles Taylor began to question the validity of purely individualistic political theory, and attempted to counter the “atomism” \citep{Taylor1985} of neoliberal politics with a more communitarian approach.

These issues took on particular resonance in the context of specific political struggles and controversies in Canada - over multiculturalism, Quebec sovereignty, and Settler-Indigenous relationships in particular - and led to a particularly Canadian “politics of recognition” in the 1990s. We will look at that development in a moment, but first it is useful to place the communitarian-liberalism debate in the broader context of political thought.
In a major work on the politics of recognition, Axel Honneth traces a decline of situating individuals first and foremost in their social and collective relationships to the advent of modernity and the development of capitalism. The social contract theory of, for example, Hobbes - underpinned by the development of the “bourgeois ideology” of Descartes and the scientific revolution - inaugurated the methodological individualism that would become central to liberal political philosophy from Locke onward. Hegel, on the other hand, challenged such individualistic social theories (what Marx dismissed as “Robinsonades”) in the name of the primacy of social relations. In Honneth’s words, 

\begin{quote}

Hegel labels all those approaches to natural law [e.g. Hobbes’] ‘empirical’ that start out from a fictitious or anthropological characterization of human nature and then, on the basis of this and with the help of further assumptions, propose a rational organization of collective life within society. The atomistic premises of theories of this type are reflected in the fact that they always conceive of the purportedly ‘natural’ form of human behaviour exclusively as the isolated acts of solitary individuals, to which forms of community-formation must then be added as a further thought, as if externally. \citep[12]{honneth-struggle}. 

\end{quote}

This critique of social contract theory, in which individuals come first and then choose or decide to come together in a community or society, is Marx’s main critique of Proudhon in The Poverty of Philosophy, and in the 1857 ‘Introduction’, Marx argues that the isolated individual which liberal political economists take as their starting point is in fact the end result of a process of social and political alienation which took place over hundreds of years. The transhistorical timelessness and universality of liberal political thought is, as we will see, unable to understand the historical (that is, changing) nature of subjectivity itself, tends to misread Hegel’s intersubjective conception of identity-formation, and ignores the entire tendency of Marxist engagement with the question of the relationship of individuals to society. As a result, liberal philosophers like Taylor make the same mistake as the classical political economists: they presume the isolated, atomistic individualism of capitalist modernity to be a timeless truth about human nature (rather than the result of specific social and political processes), and therefore take individuals as the social starting point, even as they offer a communitarian critique of both “high liberalism” and libertarianism.


In the aftermath of the communitarian/liberalism debates, Alan Patten (\cite{patten-2014} has identified two broad tendencies in liberal theory with respect to minority rights. On the one hand there is the “liberal culturalist” position adhered to by both Kymlicka and Taylor, which takes the need to protect collective minority rights seriously. On the other hand is an older liberalism which derives mainly from the work of Rawls, and which sees collective rights as fully reducible to individual rights, and which Patten identifies with the work of Waldron, Barry, Appiah, and others \cite[4]{patten-2014}. Besides maintaining that the older liberalism is fully adequate to the protection of minority rights, this position points to potential drawbacks of the liberal culturalist programme, such as the impossibility of national solidarity and the fragmentation of social cohesion into special interest groups. In American librarianship, the older, Rawlsian liberalism tends to hold sway, while in Canada - due precisely to debates around Canadian multiculturalism, Indigenous and Quebecois sovereignty - the liberal culturalist position is predominant.

Within the liberal culturalist position, we can identify two tendencies, one towards a “politics of difference”, for example in the work of Kymlicka, and one towards a “politics of recognition” formalized by Taylor and adopted by Tully. For Kymlicka, the permanent differentiation of collective minority rights anathema to more traditional liberals was based on a mistaken understanding of the term “collective rights”. Kymlicka distinguishes between the rights of a group that “limit[s] the liberty of its own individual members in the name of group solidarity or cultural purity” and “the right of a group to limit the economic or political power exercised by the larger society over the group”, and concludes that this second form of collective right need not conflict with the traditional liberal rights of individuals.

In Canada, a practical politics of recognition came before its theoretical formulation in the aftermath of the communitarian/liberalism debate. In 1969, the Canadian Government attempted to leverage the post-war sense of social solidarity and national unity to impose a policy of assimilation on Indigenous peoples (embodied in the 1969 “White Paper”). Indigenous resistance to this policy was strong, and the government quickly backed away from such a project, preferring instead to adopt “recognition” as the primary way of negotiating relations between Indigenous peoples and the settler-colonial state. This shift must be understood in the context of other international decolonizing and post-colonial struggles (for example in Algeria), and in this sense is connected with Quebec separatism which reached a peak in the October Crisis of 1970. While the defeat of the FLQ marked the end of support for violent insurrection in the name of Quebecois independence, it set the stage for Canadian multicultural debates (themselves necessitated by the increase in immigration in the aftermath of decolonization) and, after the patriation of the constitution in 1982, for several rounds of unsuccessful attempts at constitutional reform. These attempts brought about a crisis in the method of recognition, as the recognition of Quebec as a distinct society came up against the impossibility of recognizing Indigenous self-determination, and recognition was reduced to an affirmation of “cultural” identity (enshrined in the Multiculturalism Act of 1988) rather than a means of social, political, and economic transformation (“affirmation” and “transformation” are used here in Nancy Fraser’s sense).

The theory of the politics of recognition grew out of the communitarian critique of individualistic liberalism, attempting to restore community and social relationships to a place in their social ontology, if only a subordinate one. The politics of recognition in Canada - exemplified by the work of Taylor and Tully - reinforced the “empirical” perspective of social contract theory, in which individuals come first and social relationships are added after the fact. Despite relying on Hegel’s master/slave dialectic in his essay on recognition \citep{Taylor1994}, Taylor still sees the intersubjective recognition as being entered into by autonomous individuals. In addition, the reduction of recognition to “cultural recognition” (as in Tully) constrained such a politics to an affirmative rather than a transformational order.
The prior existence and causal power of social relations, on the one hand, and the rejection of redistribution in favour of recognition on the other hand, led fairly quickly to critiques of recognition from the perspectives of Indigenous rights, minority rights, and identity politics. At the same time, recognition became and continues to be one of the major demands of marginalized communities because it includes them in the state and juridical apparatus of the protection of rights (see, for example, Sally Hines’ work on recognition and the UK Gender Recognition Act of 2004 \citep{Hines2013}). Nancy Fraser has criticized recognition for its restriction to an “affirmative” role in social justice, leaving the structures of oppression and injustice intact \citep{Fraser1997, fraser-honneth}. Glen Sean Coulthard has criticized Taylor in particular for assuming an equality between the actors in intersubjective recognition, which erases the vast power differential between the settler state and Indigenous peoples \citep{coulthard2014}. Dean Spade has challenged the value of recognition and inclusion from the perspective of transgender people because recognition paradoxically inscribed them more deeply into structures of state power, police brutality, and the administrative violence of gender norms \citep{Spade2015}. Jakeet Singh has criticized recognition for its ‘top-down’ approach to rights \citep{singh-recognition} and calls for a decolonized radical democracy as an alternative approach \citep{singh-democracy}.Thus, while recognition continues to be an important tool in the construction and maintenance of liberal-democratic hegemony over marginalized peoples, its insistence on an individualistic social-contract approach to identity formation on the one hand, and a cultural idealism which resists material transformation on the other, leads the politics of recognition continually into the kind of aporias we see playing out in controversies within librarianship (to which we will return).


Hegel and the Ethical Unification of the People

The liberal-communitarian debate can be boiled down to the idea that, given the major social transformation that had occurred since the early 1970s (or even, really, since the end of the second world war) either the liberal focus on the “unencumbered self” \citep{Sandel1984} and individual rights remained completely adequate and the best way to ensure a just society, or it had been rendered inadequate (and the resulting society unjust) and so a communitarian corrective had to be applied (see Taylor’s critique of Kymlicka \cite{TaylorKymlicka}). While Kymlicka is fully aware of the Marxist critique of liberalism \citep{Kymlicka1989}, in many ways the liberal-communitarian debate simply reproduces Hegel’s critique of atomistic individual (Kantian) social theory from the vintage point of the transition to the post-colonial, multinational, and polyethnic societies that entered into neoliberalism. Communitarians recognized the corrosion of society brought about by the “atomism” of individualistic neoliberalism, as well as the challenges to social solidarity necessitated by the struggle of social movements based on allegiances to collectivities different from the nation-state, and so their goal was, like Hegel’s, the achievement of a “natural ethical life” \citep[102]{Hegel1979} arising out of a “genuinely free community of living connections” \citep[145]{Hegel1977}. Where the liberals and communitarians disagreed was whether freedom was something that belonged to an isolated individual, or whether it arose out of an individual’s social relations (note that the communitarians do not go so far as to say that freedom is produced by an individual’s social relations). Like the targets of Hegel’s critique (Kant and Fichte), communitarians like Sandel and Taylor attempted to show that a natural ethical life could not be predicated on an individualistic social ontology. However, even the communitarian perspective continues to be based on an individualistic assumption, on “the existence of subjects who are isolated from each other” but who choose to form social bonds (a classical liberal perspective Marx challenged in The Poverty of Philosophy and the Grundrisse). As a result, from a Hegelian or Marxist perspective, communitarianism and liberalism alike cannot form the basis of a “condition of ethical unification among people” because the necessary social and communal relationships are seen as contingent, and therefore come to the individual after the fact \citep[12]{honneth-struggle}.
A certain complication arises when Taylor refers to Hegel in his investigation of the politics of recognition (which must be understood as a particular application of communitarianism). Taylor ignores Hegel’s earlier work on social philosophy and relies solely on a short passage from the Phenomenology of Spirit (the master-slave dialectic), and thus misunderstands three key aspects of Hegel’s social theory. First is that individual subjects are born into social relations. As Honneth puts it, for Hegel “every philosophical theory of society must proceed not from the acts of isolated subjects but rather from the framework of ethical bonds, within which subjects always-already move” \citep[14]{honneth-struggle} (this insight forms the basis of historical materialism: history is made not “under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past” \cite{Marx1963}). Secondly, Taylor’s vision of the self is that individual identity is static and unchanging, so that the process of recognition becomes no longer (as in Hegel) a dynamic process of change, but merely the social contract rephrased in Hegelian terms. Thirdly, Taylor conceives of both subjects involved in mutual recognition as equals. Both the static nature of identity and the presumption of equality (i.e. the evacuation of power differences) is characteristic of liberalism in both its communitarian and “liberal” forms, emphasizing self-direction, free choice, and equality in favour of social structures, necessity, and power imbalances. It is in this way that contemporary forms of liberalism continue the project of legitimating capitalist social and political relations in the changed context of the late-20th and early-21st century.

From the beginning, the political theory of recognition (which I should distinguish from the “politics of recognition” operationalized by the Canadian state) has been constrained by its reduction of difference to “cultural difference”. As Coulthard points out, the power imbalance between the settler state and Indigenous peoples is not a cultural difference but a material one. Furthermore, drawing on the work of Kanien’kehá:ka scholar Taiaiake Alfred, Coulthard notes that   Indigenous sovereignty and relationship to the land must be anti-capitalist; any attempt to reduce the difference between capitalist and non-capitalist modes of production as “cultural” can only serve the interests of capitalist hegemony. A capitalist mode of production cannot “recognize” a non-capitalist one, but must attempt to overcome or assimilate it. 
Similarly, Nancy Fraser has shown how the politics of recognition channels activism and insurgency away from redistribution, with the result that 
\begin{quote}
the most salient social movements are no longer economically defined ‘classes’ who are struggling to defend their ‘interests’, end ‘exploitation’, and win ‘redistribution’. Instead, they are culturally defined ‘groups’ or ‘communities of values’ who are struggling to defend their ‘identities’, end ‘cultural domination’, and win ‘recognition’. The result is a decoupling of cultural politics from social politics, and the relative eclipse of the latter by the former. \citep[2]{Fraser1997}
\end{quote}

Even more dangerously, “recognition” can end up more deeply implicating marginalized identities in the administrative structures of medicine and the police, subjecting trans people, for example, to unwanted medicalized intervention, police brutality, and the carceral logic of the state. Trans activist, prison abolitionist, and Seattle university law professor Dean Spade, has argued that the recognition of trans identities in, for example, hate speech codes (such as Canada’s Bill C-16 which we will have cause to revisit later), while a seemingly laudable development, can in fact inscribe transgender people in structures of administrative subjection, making them more subject to alienation and oppression under capitalism \citep{Spade2015}.
In many ways it is the very intersectionality of these critiques that challenges the purported universalism of liberal theory (in both its individualist and communitarian variants). The primacy of “always already” existing social relationships, the material (i.e. non-cultural) vectors of inequality, such as rights over land or medically enshrined binaries of sex and gender, and the rejection of individualist and idealist conceptions of rights and equality appear to challenge the political theory of recognition itself. However, the political theory of recognition is, as we have seen, the product of particular debates within liberalism, as well as specific Canadian political problems, which raises the question of whether a non-liberal, anti-capitalist politics of recognition is possible, a politics of recognition which is able to take on board the critiques of Coulthard, Fraser, Spade, and others, to unify them without losing their specific focus and differences. In order to try to answer this question, I will look at recent issues surrounding Intellectual Freedom in Canadian libraries which touch on all of these topics. In Canada, I will argue, Intellectual Freedom is strongly informed by the politics of recognition; what would a liberatory Intellectual Freedom look like based on this alternative conception of the politics of recognition?

            <Text>In many ways, the communitarian/liberalism debate simply reproduced Hegel’s critique of atomistic individual social theory from the vantage point of the transition from the post-war compromise to neoliberalism. Communitarians like Taylor, Kymlicka, and to some extent James Tully, recognized the corrosion of society brought about by the “atomism” of individualistic neoliberalism, as well as the challenges to social solidarity necessitated by the struggle of social movements based on allegiances to collectivities different from the nation-state, and so their goal was, like Hegel’s, the achievement of a “natural ethical life” (\citep[102]{Hegel1979}) arising out of a “genuinely free community of living connections” (\citep[145]{Hegel1977}). Like Hegel’s opponents (mainly Kant and Fichte), the communitarian critique of liberalism attempted to show that a natural ethical life could not be predicated on an individualistic social ontology. However, even the communitarian perspective that informs Taylor’s politics of recognition, Kymlicka’s multicultural citizenship, and Tully’s politics of cultural recognition, do not go far enough. They continue to be based on an atomistic individualism, on “the existence of subjects who are isolated from each other” and therefore the communitarian perspective also cannot form the basis of a “condition of ethical unification among people” because the necessary social and communal relationships have to be added to them after the fact (\citep[12]{honneth-struggle}).
I will claim that this mistake is based on a misreading of Hegel on the part of Taylor, who ignores Hegel’s early work on political theory to base his interpretation of Hegel’s theory of recognition solely on a short passage from The Phenomenology of Spirit. Taylor ignores or misunderstand three key aspects of Hegel’s political ontology. The first, as we have seen, is that individual subjects are born into social relations. As Honneth puts it, for Hegel “every philosophical theory of society must proceed not from the acts of isolated subjects ut rather from the framework of ethical bonds, within which subjects always already move” (\citep[14]{honneth-struggle}). The second is that individual identity is static and unchanging, so that the process of recognition becomes no longer (as in Hegel) a dynamic process of change, but merely the social contract rephrased in Hegelian terms. Third is that the subjects involved in the process of recognition are equals. Both the static nature of identity and the presumption of equality (i.e. the evacuation of power differences) is characteristic of the bourgeois ideology that informs liberalism in both its individualistic and communitarian forms.
These three divergences from Hegel’s political philosophy in Taylor’s theory of identity and recognition go on to inform the constitutional theories of Kymlicka and Tully. In Chapter Two I will dig more deeply into Taylor’s theory of the self, community, and recognition, and then show, first, how Honneth’s more sophisticated reading of Hegel undercuts Taylor’s theory, placing Kymlicka and Tully’s constitutional theories in jeopardy, and second, how Hegel’s political theory in fact has more in common with Antonio Negri’s theory of constituent power than is usually allowed. For example, while for Hegel atomistic social ontologies can only conceive of a community “on the abstract model of a ‘unified many’, that is, as a cluster of single subjects, and thus not on the model of an ethical unity”(\citep[12]{honneth-struggle}). While corporate social and political theories try to forge a community under the banner of a single collectivity (nation, or people, for example), the multitudo is, in the words of Paolo Virno , “the form of social and political existence for the many, seen as being many” “without converging into a One” (\citep[21]{Virno2004}). The multitude, for Negri and Virno, is both a “many” composed of individuals, while also being an “ethical unity” of the type envisaged by Hegel.
For Hardt and Negri, the multitude preserves the differences of individual subjects, without forcing them into a unity (“people” or “masses” or even “working class”), and yet managing  “to communicate and act in common while remaining internally different” (\citep[xiv]{HardtNegri2004}). “Insofar as the multitude is neither an identity,” they write, “nor uniform… the internal difference of the multitude must discover the common that allows them to communicate and act together” (citep[xv]{HardtNegri2004}). In Chapter Three we will compare Kymlicka and Tully’s constitutionalism against the “ethical unification of people” and (in Chapter Four) demonstrate how Negri’s theory of the multitude both avoids the pitfalls of the liberal social ontology while also answering the criticisms of the politics of recognition made by Indigenous, Feminist, and Queer critics.

Negri would argue against Hegel that the unity of the people (as multitude) already exists, but it has been fractured and fragmented by the State. Hegel gets it the wrong way round in looking for a way to unify the people.</Text>

            <Text>The theory of the “politics of recognition” arose as a particular tendency out of the communitarian/liberalism debates of the 1980s. The turn to neoliberalism saw the beginnings of the dismantling of the Welfare State along with a decline in the social solidarity of the post-war consensus. This decline was in part caused by, in part opened the door to, expressions of individual desire and a rejection of communitarian compromise in the name of consumer choice on the one hand, and the radical rejection of the Establishment in the counterculture of the 1960s, whose most radical expression was in the worker and student revolts of 1968. This resurgent individualism was harnessed by neoliberal theorists in their push to implement free-market reforms and to drive individual consumerism as two of the main [drivers] of their political and economic theory \citep{harvey-2005}. The social and political effects of this transition are diagnosed by, for example, Marcuse, but also by Deleuze, Guattari, Derrida, and others: the shift to neoliberalism can, following Jameson, be understood as provoking a shift towards post-structuralism and other “postmodern” philosophical positions \citep{Jameson1991}. Justice - both individual and post-colonial - played a major role in the development of post-structuralist theory at the end of the 1960s. The editors of Deconstruction and the Possibility of Justice note that while “at least by its critics, deconstruction has been associated with cynicism towards the very idea of justice”, it is “in some way, aligned with the marginalized” \citep[ix]{CornellRosenfeldCarleson1992}.

[David Harvey, in his Brief History of Neoliberalism, marks 1968 not only as the introduction of  postcolonial immigrant multiculturalism in to Western political life, but of the irruption of an individualistic conatus after two-decades of a post-war consensus that required the repression of individual desires for the collective good of the welfare state: “The student movements that swept the world in 1968… were in part animated by the quest for greater freedoms of speech and of personal choice. More generally, these ideals appeal to anyone who values the ability to make decisions for themselves.” \citep[5]{harvey-2005}

Harvey goes on to argue that the explosion of the desire for individual freedom opened the door to neoliberal policies based on radical individualism and free-market fundamentalism, deregulation and privatization, summed up by Margaret Thatcher’s remark that “there’s no such thing as society, there are individual men and women and there are families”. As Stuart Hall remarked about this conjunctural shift, while “the Keynsian welfare state tried to set ‘the common good’ above profitability’, neoliberalism meant that ‘the function of the liberal state should be limited to safeguarding the the conditions in which profitable competition can be pursued without engendering Hobbes’ ‘war of all against all’” \citep[707]{hall-2011} ]

In response to this, liberal theorists like John Rawls sought to restore liberalism’s primacy in questions of justice and political philosophy, with Rawls’ Theory of Justice (1971) “reinvigorat[ing] ‘high liberalism’ \citep[3]{Galisanka2019} for the neoliberal turn. By the end of the 1970s, however, as neoliberalism had led not only to the political projects of Thatcher, Reagan, and others, a reinvigoration not just of liberalism, but libertarianism, had developed. Robert Nozick’s Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974) directly challenged Rawls’ conception of the role of the state in the distribution of justice, and argued. Connecting Nozick’s individualist libertarianism and a “methodological individualism” present in Rawls’ Theory with the effects of the neoliberal dismantling of the Welfare State, especially after the elections of Thatcher (1979) and Reagan (1980), many political philosophers such as Michael Sandel, Michael Walzer, Alistair McIntyre, and  Charles Taylor began to question the validity of purely individualistic political theory, and attempted to counter the “atomism” \citep{Taylor1985} of neoliberal politics with a more communitarian approach.
These issues took on particular resonance in the context of specific political struggles and controversies in Canada - over multiculturalism, Quebec sovereignty, and Settler-Indigenous relationships in particular - and led to a particularly Canadian “politics of recognition” in the 1990s. We will look at that development in a moment, but first it is useful to place the communitarian-liberalism debate in the broader context of political thought.
In a major work on the politics of recognition, Axel Honneth traces a decline of situating individuals first and foremost in their social and collective relationships to the advent of modernity and the development of capitalism. The social contract theory of, for example, Hobbes - underpinned by the development of the “bourgeois ideology” of Descartes and the scientific revolution - inaugurated the methodological individualism that would become central to liberal political philosophy from Locke onward. Hegel, on the other hand, challenged such individualistic social theories (what Marx dismissed as “Robinsonades”) in the name of the primacy of social relations. In Honneth’s words, 

\begin{quote}

Hegel labels all those approaches to natural law [e.g. Hobbes’] ‘empirical’ that start out from a fictitious or anthropological characterization of human nature and then, on the basis of this and with the help of further assumptions, propose a rational organization of collective life within society. The atomistic premises of theories of this type are reflected in the fact that they always conceive of the purportedly ‘natural’ form of human behaviour exclusively as the isolated acts of solitary individuals, to which forms of community-formation must then be added as a further thought, as if externally. \citep[12]{honneth-struggle}. 

\end{quote}

This critique of social contract theory, in which individuals come first and then choose or decide to come together in a community or society, is Marx’s main critique of Proudhon in The Poverty of Philosophy, and in the 1857 ‘Introduction’, Marx argues that the isolated individual which liberal political economists take as their starting point is in fact the end result of a process of social and political alienation which took place over hundreds of years. The transhistorical timelessness and universality of liberal political thought is, as we will see, unable to understand the historical (that is, changing) nature of subjectivity itself, tends to misread Hegel’s intersubjective conception of identity-formation, and ignores the entire tendency of Marxist engagement with the question of the relationship of individuals to society. As a result, liberal philosophers like Taylor make the same mistake as the classical political economists: they presume the isolated, atomistic individualism of capitalist modernity to be a timeless truth about human nature (rather than the result of specific social and political processes), and therefore take individuals as the social starting point, even as they offer a communitarian critique of both “high liberalism” and libertarianism.


In the aftermath of the communitarian/liberalism debates, Alan Patten (\cite{patten-2014} has identified two broad tendencies in liberal theory with respect to minority rights. On the one hand there is the “liberal culturalist” position adhered to by both Kymlicka and Taylor, which takes the need to protect collective minority rights seriously. On the other hand is an older liberalism which derives mainly from the work of Rawls, and which sees collective rights as fully reducible to individual rights, and which Patten identifies with the work of Waldron, Barry, Appiah, and others \cite[4]{patten-2014}. Besides maintaining that the older liberalism is fully adequate to the protection of minority rights, this position points to potential drawbacks of the liberal culturalist programme, such as the impossibility of national solidarity and the fragmentation of social cohesion into special interest groups. In American librarianship, the older, Rawlsian liberalism tends to hold sway, while in Canada - due precisely to debates around Canadian multiculturalism, Indigenous and Quebecois sovereignty - the liberal culturalist position is predominant.

Within the liberal culturalist position, we can identify two tendencies, one towards a “politics of difference”, for example in the work of Kymlicka, and one towards a “politics of recognition” formalized by Taylor and adopted by Tully. For Kymlicka, the permanent differentiation of collective minority rights anathema to more traditional liberals was based on a mistaken understanding of the term “collective rights”. Kymlicka distinguishes between the rights of a group that “limit[s] the liberty of its own individual members in the name of group solidarity or cultural purity” and “the right of a group to limit the economic or political power exercised by the larger society over the group”, and concludes that this second form of collective right need not conflict with the traditional liberal rights of individuals.

In Canada, a practical politics of recognition came before its theoretical formulation in the aftermath of the communitarian/liberalism debate. In 1969, the Canadian Government attempted to leverage the post-war sense of social solidarity and national unity to impose a policy of assimilation on Indigenous peoples (embodied in the 1969 “White Paper”). Indigenous resistance to this policy was strong, and the government quickly backed away from such a project, preferring instead to adopt “recognition” as the primary way of negotiating relations between Indigenous peoples and the settler-colonial state. This shift must be understood in the context of other international decolonizing and post-colonial struggles (for example in Algeria), and in this sense is connected with Quebec separatism which reached a peak in the October Crisis of 1970. While the defeat of the FLQ marked the end of support for violent insurrection in the name of Quebecois independence, it set the stage for Canadian multicultural debates (themselves necessitated by the increase in immigration in the aftermath of decolonization) and, after the patriation of the constitution in 1982, for several rounds of unsuccessful attempts at constitutional reform. These attempts brought about a crisis in the method of recognition, as the recognition of Quebec as a distinct society came up against the impossibility of recognizing Indigenous self-determination, and recognition was reduced to an affirmation of “cultural” identity (enshrined in the Multiculturalism Act of 1988) rather than a means of social, political, and economic transformation (“affirmation” and “transformation” are used here in Nancy Fraser’s sense).

The theory of the politics of recognition grew out of the communitarian critique of individualistic liberalism, attempting to restore community and social relationships to a place in their social ontology, if only a subordinate one. The politics of recognition in Canada - exemplified by the work of Taylor and Tully - reinforced the “empirical” perspective of social contract theory, in which individuals come first and social relationships are added after the fact. Despite relying on Hegel’s master/slave dialectic in his essay on recognition \citep{Taylor1992}, Taylor still sees the intersubjective recognition as being entered into by autonomous individuals. In addition, the reduction of recognition to “cultural recognition” (as in Tully) constrained such a politics to an affirmative rather than a transformational order.
The prior existence and causal power of social relations, on the one hand, and the rejection of redistribution in favour of recognition on the other hand, led fairly quickly to critiques of recognition from the perspectives of Indigenous rights, minority rights, and identity politics. At the same time, recognition became and continues to be one of the major demands of marginalized communities because it includes them in the state and juridical apparatus of the protection of rights (see, for example, Sally Hines’ work on recognition and the UK Gender Recognition Act of 2004 \citep{Hines2013}). Nancy Fraser has criticized recognition for its restriction to an “affirmative” role in social justice, leaving the structures of oppression and injustice intact \citep{fraser-justice, fraser-honneth}. Glen Sean Coulthard has criticized Taylor in particular for assuming an equality between the actors in intersubjective recognition, which erases the vast power differential between the settler state and Indigenous peoples \citep{coulthard2014}. Dean Spade has challenged the value of recognition and inclusion from the perspective of transgender people because recognition paradoxically inscribed them more deeply into structures of state power, police brutality, and the administrative violence of gender norms \citep{Spade2015}. Jakeet Singh has criticized recognition for its ‘top-down’ approach to rights \citep{singh-recognition} and calls for a decolonized radical democracy as an alternative approach \citep{singh-democracy}.Thus, while recognition continues to be an important tool in the construction and maintenance of liberal-democratic hegemony over marginalized peoples, its insistence on an individualistic social-contract approach to identity formation on the one hand, and a cultural idealism which resists material transformation on the other, leads the politics of recognition continually into the kind of aporias we see playing out in controversies within librarianship (to which we will return).</Text>

            <Title>Diversity, Minority Rights, and the Politics of Recognition</Title>
            <Text>In the early to mid 1990s, concerns around what Charles Taylor called the “narcissism” of individualistic neoliberalism provoked a constellation of responses. Firstly, there was the  development of a communitarian liberalism which sought to critique the individualism of classical liberalism and to reinstate a notion of collective responsibility, for example in Taylor’s work on the sources of modern individualism and the role it played in modern society (\cite{taylor-1989, Taylor-1991}). Secondly, there was the work done by Will Kymlicka, Charles Taylor, and others to challenge the dominant ways of understanding multiculturalism and minority rights (\cite{kymlicka-citizenship, taylor-1992, honneth-1995, fraser-1997}. Thirdly, there was the work done by James Tully on constitutionalism and diversity (\cite{tully-1995}). All of this work not only engaged with the changed nature of multicultural and multinational nation states with neoliberal turn, but also with the rise of identity-based social movements in the 1960s (and most especially after 1968), and with the end of the threat posed by the Eastern bloc countries which had been seen as anti-individualistic. The collapse of the Soviet Union opened up space for a collectivist critique of the individualism unleashed by neoliberal politics and economics, especially in the acquisitive decade par excellence, the 1980s. Furthermore, in the Canadian context, renewed Indigenous and Quebecois resistance to Canadian assimilation - the Kanehsatà:ke uprising in 1990 and the referendum on Quebecois independence in 1995 - for example, brought issues of assimilation vs. respect for minority rights very much to the forefront of Canadian cultural and political debates. The work of Kymlicka, Taylor, Tully, and others was an attempt to deal with the new realities of a unipolar, post-colonial, multiethnic and multinational polity. What they had in common was an attempt to update liberal theory to account for the post-welfare state realities of neoliberalism.
Patten (\cite{patten-2014} identified two broad tendencies in liberal theory with respect to minority rights. On the one hand there is the “liberal culturalist” position adhered to by both Kymlicka and Taylor, which takes the need to protect collective minority rights seriously, while on the other hand is an older liberalism which derives mainly from the work of Rawls, and which sees collective rights as fully reducible to individual rights, and which Patten identifies with the work of Waldron, Barry, Appiah, and others \cite[4]{patten-2014}. Besides maintaining that the older liberalism is fully adequate to the protection of minority rights, this position points to potential drawbacks of the liberal culturalist programme, such as the impossibility of national solidarity and the fragmentation of social cohesion into special interest groups. In librarianship, the older, Rawlsian liberalism tends to hold sway, while in Canada - due precisely to debates around Canadian multiculturalism, Indigenous and Quebecois sovereignty - the liberal culturalist position is predominant.
Within the liberal culturalist position, we can identify two tendencies, one towards a “politics of difference”, for example in the work of Kymlicka, and one towards a “politics of recognition” formalized by Taylor and adopted by Tully. For Kymlicka, the permanent differentiation of collective minority rights anathema to more traditional liberals was based on a mistaken understanding of the term “collective rights”. Kymlicka distinguishes between the rights of a group that “limit[s] the liberty of its own individual members in the name of group solidarity or cultural purity” and “the right of a group to limit the economic or political power exercised by the larger society over the group”, and concludes that this second form of collective right need not conflict with the traditional liberal rights of individuals.
If Kymlicka looks at the problem from the perspective of the aggregate (collectivity, nation state), Taylor takes the opposite approach and builds up his politics of recognition from the starting point of an intersubjective theory of identity formation derived (problematically) from Hegel…</Text>

            <Text>General Non-Fiction (LATEX)

About This Template
The goal of this template is make the composition and drafting phase as simple and elegant as possible. It is not meant to turn Scrivener, a rich text editor, into a full-blown LaTeX generator (you'll need to use MultiMarkdown or Pandoc for that; consider using the General Non-Fiction template if that is what you are looking for). Instead, this project contains a number of convenience features that could be applied to your work as you wish in an à la carte fashion, to alleviate how much code you'd need to type in yourself. For example, if you find handling images to be cumbersome in LaTeX, you can safely leave that up to the template.

This template caters to those that by and large prefer to compose directly in LaTeX itself, and will be approaching Scrivener primarily as an organisational and composition tool for constructing a longer .tex file from the smaller snippets written into the Draft folder.

When compiled (File ▸ Compile…), this project will generate a bare bones .tex document (using the flexible Memoir class) suitable for many types of work, fiction and non-fiction alike. The template achieves this by using advanced features available to the Plain Text compile file type, including providing the default extension of ".tex" instead of ".txt".

How To Use This Template
	◆	Inside the “Draft” folder, create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. (LaTeX itself will of course handle all numbering schemes.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
	◆	Create a new text document for each section inside the chapter folders. Sections will be numbered and titled by LaTeX using hierarchical numbering (1.1, 1.2, 1.3).
	◦	Nest documents beneath documents to create numbered subsections, subsubsections and unnumbered paragraphs, at 3rd, 4th and 5th levels of hierarchy respectively.
	◦	You can of course also nest folders if you prefer.
	◆	If you need to create the occasional unnumbered section, the Informal Chapter and Informal Section Types can be manually applied to those sections.
	◆	If you don’t require a foreword, move the “Foreword” document in the Front Matter folder to the Trash folder. Alternatively, rename it “Preface”, “Abstract” or “Introduction” as you require. Adjust the title, table of contents and other front matter material within this folder, placing any additional front matter sections between the “Begin Document” and “Begin Main Matter” items.
	◆	“Notes” and “Ideas” folders have been provided for your convenience, although you can replace them or create different top-level folders for your research materials if necessary (these are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents ▸ Change Icon feature).

General Writing Tips
Foremost, any LaTeX you type in yourself will be dutifully conveyed to the output. As such, you can treat the main editor in Scrivener much like you would a dedicated text editor such as TeXShop. You may still prefer to use another editor to construct LaTeX syntax more easily, or take advantage of the syntax highlighting these types of editors can afford. Simply copy and paste the results of your writings into Scrivener when you’re ready to “save” them.

Adjusting Outline Structure
Scrivener is designed so that you can use the Draft outline flexibly. The default settings for this template are set up to consider all items at the first level within the draft as chapters. Beneath that, all items will be considered sections, subsections and so on down to the \paragraph environment. To adjust these settings, use the Project ▸ Project Settings… menu command, click on the “Section Types” pane, and then the “Default Types by Structure” tab. For example, if you wanted the top level of the Draft to use parts instead of chapters, you could select “Part” (which has already been set up for you) for the Level 1 assignments, and then adjust all greater levels of depth accordingly.

It is also worth noting that under default settings, if you omit a title for a binder item it will become "anonymous", not producing any title material and by extension opting out of being a part of the formal structure of the document as compiled. You could also manually assign an item to the “N/A” section type to cause it to be printed as-is, if you would prefer to give it an casual outlining title.

Compiling
	◆	The “Front Matter” folder contains some example preamble of the sort that would follow the more rudimentary setup of the document's overall look and feel (that is delegated to the compile Format itself, making it possible to create your own target formats and switch document classes with a single click).
	◆	A “Back Matter” folder is also provided. Here you can add any back matter you wish to include before the final \end{document} command. Nothing provided in this folder is necessary for a simple document to be typeset.  An example structure has been provided for including an appendix. The folder itself is assigned to the "Appendix" Section Type, which is responsible for titling the section and then starting the formal appendix portion of the document. Within that folder the ordinary structural rules for the Draft folder will be adhered to, meaning you can construct complex appendices with sections, subsections and so forth, based on the hierarchy of the outline. If you do not need an appendix, you can remove this folder.

	◆	To compile:
	◦	Go to File ▸ Compile…
	◦	Next to “Compile for”, select “Plain Text (.txt)”.
	◦	Select the “LaTeX (Memoir Book)” compile format on the left.
	◦	Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right. If you do not do this the resulting .tex file will not properly typeset until the example material has been copied to an area included in the compile (such as the top of the Draft folder). The “Add back matter” feature is optional.
	◦	Click on “Compile”, open the .tex file in your preferred editor and typeset the document.

	◆	To compile directly to PDF:
	◦	Go to File ▸ Compile...
	◦	Double-click the “LaTeX (Memoir Book)” compile format to edit it.
	◦	Click on the Processing compile format pane.
	◦	Enable the “Post-Process on command-line” option to enable the built-in script.
	◦	Optional: click the “Edit Script” button and review the script for any changes you would like to make. The script is set up to use XeLaTeX, you might prefer to use the -pdf switch instead, for pdflatex output.
	◦	Optional: ensure that the Environment field includes the path to your texbin (for example “/Library/TeX/texbin”, as set up by MacTex).
	◦	Click the “Save” button, and then “Compile”. Note you will be supplying the name of the intermediary .tex file. The .pdf will use the base name, so “something.tex” will become “something.pdf” in the end.

	◆	To create your own document class variation:
	◦	Go to File ▸ Compile…
	◦	Right-click on the “LaTeX (Memoir Book)” compile format on the left, and select Duplicate &amp; Edit Format….
	◦	Rename the format at the top to match your intended edits.
	◦	Click on the Text Layout compile format preference pane.
	◦	Modify the prefix and suffix fields to include you preferred preamble and footer.
	◦	Since some of the LaTeX code used elsewhere in the settings may require adjustment to work outside of Memoir, you might need to audit the rest of the format's panes and content therein.
	◦	Click on “Save”.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few things to the binder and set everything up in ways that should be useful to authors working toward the LaTeX typesetting system. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File ▸ Save As Template.

The rest of this guide will go over the numerous convenience features that have been added to this project.

Figures
To ease typing extensive syntax and managing your images by hand, or to simply grant yourself a nicer looking working document, you can make use of Scrivener’s native inline &amp; linked image handling facilities. Graphics that you place into the editor will be exported as files and syntax will be inserted where the image was placed. For more formal figures there are two approaches you can take (you needn't commit to either exclusively):

	◆	In your text: use the "Figure" paragraph style to have the graphic enclosed in a \begin{figure} \centering ... \end{figure} environment. You can optionally insert a caption below the image (still within the "Figure" paragraph style, so as to keep it within the environment), using the "Caption" character style. Follow the caption with a "Label" styled phrase that is a valid LaTeX style bookmark label, to give this figure a cross-reference you can refer to elsewhere. With an eye on the Format Bar, click into the three different elements below; image, caption and label, to see which styles are applied to them:

#
This is the caption. latexLogo

The example provided above would generate the following LaTeX syntax when compiled:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=175pt,height=73pt]{800px-LaTeX_logo.png}
\caption{This is the caption.} 
\label{latexLogo}
\end{figure}

	◆	As a binder item: if you prefer keeping figures in separate chunks in the binder, to facilitate searching and organisation, you can use the "Figure" Section Type setting, placing the graphic in the main editor (un-styled) and supplying the caption as custom metadata in the Inspector. (A document template has been supplied for your convenience, and with an Example Figure item in the “Research” folder for your reference.) When using this technique figure labelling will be handled automatically for you, and captioning will be done in the inspector sidebar. To cross-reference to the figure in the text, refer to the following section on cross-referencing.

Figure Customisation
To modify how styled text and embedded images are converted to LaTeX code, visit the Markup and Styles compile format panes, when editing this project's "LaTeX (Memoir Book)" format. The Markup pane itself sets how graphics print themselves, which is the \includegraphics line alone. The stylesheet settings for Figure, Caption and Label determine how the additional syntax is added around that.

To modify how images are converted to LaTeX when including them as binder items, visit the Section Layouts compile format pane and adjust the "Figure w/ Caption" layout's Prefix and Suffix tabs. As with styled text, the Markup pane is what is used to insert the graphic itself between the prefix and suffix.

Equations
A few helpful packages for equation typesetting can be enabled with the Equation Packages module, in the front matter folder. As with figures, equations can be added either to your binder as discrete items using dedicated Section Types, or into the text itself using Styles.

	◆	In your text: use the "Equation" paragraph style to enclose the selected text within a \begin{figure} ... \end{figure} environment. Use the Label character style to supply a target label to the equation, if it should be numbered and be capable of being cross-referenced. Below is an example equation and label; note how the label character style is placed within the equation paragraph itself:

P\left(A=2\middle|\frac{A^2}{B}&gt;4\right) eq:custom-label

The example provided above would generate the following LaTeX syntax when compiled:

\begin{equation}
P\left(A=2\middle|\frac{A^2}{B}&gt;4\right) \label{eq:custom-label}
\end{equation}

	◆	As a binder item: for those that prefer to keep major elements as separate binder items, this project has two document templates designed to faciliate the organisation of equations: "Equation" and "Unnumbered Equation". If you will require cross-referencing to refer to your equations, the first option is what you want. Numbered equations will be automatically labelled for you, with that label used by internal document links pointing to it, elsewhere in the Draft. Consequently, you should not supply your own \label{...} code (or use the style) with the equation text itself. Additionally you should not use the Equation style itself, within an Equation document.

Inline equations, embedded in paragraph text, are easily formatted using raw LaTeX, but if you wish to keep your source material clean of syntax, a character style has been provided with this project. Simply paint the equation with the style, and it will add the markers for you.

Tables
Scrivener cannot convert rich text tables into LaTeX code for you. You will need to provide the proper syntax yourself, however you can focus on the tabular data itself, leaving the boilerplate text to Scrivener by making use of the “Table” Section Type when applied to individual binder items. As with binder figures, you can supply a caption as metadata. A document template has been provided as an example starting point. Working this way means you can make global adjustments to table appearance more easily, by editing the “Table w/ Caption” section layout, in the compile format settings.

Itemised and Enumerated Lists
As with tables, Scrivener cannot convert its native listing environments to LaTeX. If you would prefer the convenience of these features, for simple lists you could make use of the “Itemized List” and “Enumerated List” styles, included in this template. You will note that simple hanging indent paragraph style will be used in the editor (along with a shaded background to indicate the type of list). When compiled with the provided format, these styles will be enclosed in the proper listing environment, and will prefix each line with the \item code.

Given that basic capability, you could embellish the standard output the compiler produces with your own LaTeX code inside the styled range, and thus produce nested lists.

Creating Your Own Environments
This template includes a variety of common environments already set up for you, but it is quite likely that you will need to create your own. There are two different approaches, both demonstrated in this template:

	1.	Using Section Types: examples of this approach include the figure, table and equation setups. These are comprised of the following ingredients:
	a.	A “Section Type” that can be used to flag items in your binder as needing to be associated with a particular environment. If you look at the Table document template, you will see that in the Metadata inspector pane, it has been assigned to the “Table” section type.
	b.	A “Section Layout” in the compile format settings is what does the heavy lifting. Edit the Format for this project by going to File ▸ Compile…, right-click on the project template's Format in the left sidebar to edit it, and in the “Section Layouts” pane, examine the “Table w/ Captions” layout. The prefix and suffix tabs for this layout are where the actual LaTeX code will be inserted around the text you type in the editor.
	2.	Using Styles: when environments are more likely to be found within a longer chunk of text, and would not be so useful broken out into their own sections, styles can also be used to insert a prefix and suffix around the text you type. The “Block Quote” or even “Emphasis” styles serve as examples of how this can be done. Visit the “Styles” pane in the compile format settings to examine how prefixes and suffixes are used with them.

Cross-References
Whenever you create a document link to another document within the compiled output, Scrivener will use an internally generated bookmark label to create an \autoref{...} link to that section. This works for the following Section Types automatically:

	•	Part
	•	Chapter
	•	Section
	•	Subsection
	•	Subsubsection
	•	Figure
	•	Table
	•	Equation

LaTeX will of course handle the rest of the job, in terms of numbering and correctly labelling the links. To adjust the behaviour of the code produced by Scrivener, modify the link prefix and suffix settings in the Markup compile format pane.

Typographic Punctuation
If you prefer to use LaTeX style punctuation yourself while writing, then Scrivener will not get in your way in doing so. However if you prefer to use its automatic typographic punctuation features (smart quotes, dashes and ellipses), the compile format has been configured to convert these forms of character punctuation to old style safe ASCII LaTeX methods. If you would rather work in a modern UTF-8 environment where typographic punctuation is acceptable, you could remove or disable the conversions from the Replacements compile format pane.

Notation
If you opt to include inline annotations and comments in your output, they will be converted to marginal notes and highlights using LaTeX tools for doing so. You may also make use of Scrivener's footnote features, as they will be converted to syntax for you.

Creating an Index
To an include an index of terms, you will first need to enable the Indexing Packages front matter module, along with the Index itself in the back matter folder. To do so, visit these sections and enable the “Include in Compile” option in the inspector’s Metadata tab.

As for marking indexed terms themselves, you could of course do so by hand, but you can also make use of the Index Term and Index Key styles:

	◆	Use the “Index Term” style to mark the word or phrase, directly in the text, that you wish to add to the index. When compiled, a key based on the selected text will be generated for you.
	◆	Use the “Index Key” style if the phrase itself doesn’t appear in the text, or if you want direct control over the indexing key itself.
</Text>
            <Comments>Given a quirk in how styles work with the text engine, you will need to select the image to see the "Figure" style, rather than merely placing the cursor to the left or right of it.</Comments>

            <Title>The Politics of Intellectual Freedom</Title>
            <Text>Intellectual Freedom (IF) is considered to be one of the core values of librarianship. Within the field it is held to be the equivalent of free speech or freedom of expression in constitutional contexts, and is connected to civil and human rights either through the First Amendment (in the American contexts) or the UN Declaration on Human Rights (in Commonwealth or international contexts). There is a dominant or hegemonic discourse within the profession which, like much else within librarianship, tends to understand IF and human rights more broadly as politically neutral and non-ideological. One of the goals of this thesis is to tease out some of the ideological and political assumptions and the commitments they entail. As Roy Bhaskar suggests in The Possibility of Naturalism, periods of crisis tend to expose previously opaque generative social structures to make them amenable to analysis, and thereby to change \cite[52]{bhaskar-1979}. It is another goal of this thesis to provide a framework for a changed understanding both of the politics of recognition and of intellectual freedom. The current context, marked by pandemic and worldwide social unrest, requires an engagement with political theory in order to properly understand and transform librarianship itself.

Intellectual Freedom was enshrined in librarianship on the eve of the Second World War, with the creation of the Library Bill of Rights in 1938, modelled on the American Constitution \cite[147-152]{samek-if1}. The creation of the UN Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 added international juridical weight to the idea of intellectual freedom, and formed the basis of non-American IF statements, such as those developed by the Canadian Library Association (1974) \cite{cla-if}, the Canadian Federation of Library Associations (2016) \cite{cfla-if}, and the International Federation of Library Associations (1999) \cite{ifla-if}. Despite the centrality of IF within the profession, the concept has been periodically challenged, generally from a position known simply as “social responsibility” \cite{samek-if1}, which sought to use library collections and services to further the cause of social justice. Social Responsibility is often considered to run counter to an “absolutist” conception of IF \cite[89]{gorman-2000} which sees any social (i.e. non-technical) consideration of collections and services as censorship. This attitude runs alongside the purported neutrality of libraries and library work \cite{lewis-2008} and a discourse that argues that such neutrality is necessary for libraries to uphold and maintain democratic values and practices \cite{popowich-2019}.

Criticism of the absolutist-IF position has been part of a long history of a broader challenge to particular facets of library work, going back to criticisms of library subject headings \cite{berman-1971} the position of women within the field \cite{garrison-1972}, and the social or political neutrality of collection development in the “Berninghausen debate” of the early 1970s. \cite[4-5]{samek-if1}. It is no accident that critiques of librarianship focusing on social justice arose in the period after 1968: the transition to neoliberalism challenged many of the previously-held orthodoxies of the field. Since then, “radical”, “critical” or “progressive” librarianship has continued to critique the profession by exposing the power relations built into classification systems \cite{olson-2002}, or the gendered and racialized culture of librarianship [\cite{lew-yousefi-2017, schlesselman-tarango-2017, chou-pho-2018}]. The current period of crisis as we transition out of neoliberalism into whatever comes next (\cite{bonfert-2020}) has brought a new round of challenge to the orthodoxies of the profession, with intellectual freedom being particularly contested, especially since the election of Donald Trump and the resurgence of the far right since 2016. 

A series of controversies around intellectual freedom have exposed deep rifts within the profession over what has long been considered one of its core values and commitments. The connection of intellectual freedom with human rights - for example by explicit reference to Article 19 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights - allows criticism of IF-absolutism to be dismissed as anti-human-rights. This simplistic dismissal has the effect of shoring up IF-absolutism and the - often unconscious or at least unacknowledged - political commitments entails by that perspective. In the Canadian context, the rise of the right-wing can be dated to around 2016, when University of Toronto professor Jordan Peterson refused to call students by their chosen pronouns following the passing of Bill C-16 which included gender expression and sexuality as protected characteristics in both the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Canadian Criminal Code \cite{peterson-2016}. The fallout from Peterson’s notoriety, especially with the well-publicized case of Wilfrid Laurier TA Lindsay Shepherd the following year \cite{hutchins-2017}, was part of the larger controversies around free-speech on university campuses in Canada and the US \cite{mackinnon-2018}, for example around the deplatforming of right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos in 2018 \cite{Beauchamp-2018}. In addition to questions of free-speech, 2016-2018 saw the creation of far-right/white supremacist/populist movements and political parties, including the Sons of Odin (founded in Finland in 2015, first active in Canada the following year), the Proud Boys (founded 2016), the Canadian Nationalist Party (founded 2017) and the People’s Party of Canada (founded 2018). 

Thes is the context in which the most recent round of challenges to IF-absolutism arose in the summer of 2017 beginning with Toronto Public Library (TPL) renting space to a group including  Paul Fromm, international director of the white-supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens \cite{quan-2015}, and Marc Lemire, former president of the Neo-Nazi Heritage Front \cite{craggs-2019}. The space was rented for a memorial service for Barbara Kulaszka, a Toronto lawyer who had defended many right-wing cases, including that of holocaust-denier Ernst Zundel.  Kulaszka has been “credited with ensuring that no Nazi has ever been convicted for war crimes in Canada” and it has been argued that “because of her work, there are… no Canadian laws against internet hate speech” \cite{shakeri-2017}. The library defended the room-rental in the name of intellectual freedom and the protections of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. City Librarian Vickery Bowles released a statement that: 
\begin{quote}
To deny access on the basis of the views or opinions that individuals or groups hold contravenes the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the principles of intellectual freedom, both cornerstones of the library's mission and values. Sometimes in defending freedom of speech, it's very uncomfortable to be put in a situation where we are defending the rights of those whose viewpoints many consider to be offensive. However, it is at those times that we must be vigilant in protecting the rights of all. \cite{tpl-kulaszka}
\end{quote}
 Despite protests, the memorial went ahead, though under pressure from the mayor and city council the library did amend its room-rental policy to allow for the denial of a rental when the library 
\begin{quote}
reasonably believes the purpose of the booking is likely to promote, or would have the effect of promoting, discrimination, contempt or hatred of any group, p, hatred for any person on the basis of race, ethnic origin, place of origin, citizenship, colour, ancestry, language, creed (religion), age, sex, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, disability, political affiliation, membership in a union or staff association, receipt of public assistance, level of literacy or any other similar factor. \cite{tpl-revisions}
\end{quote}
This amendment to the room-rental policy will play a major role in the subsequent controversy over TPL’s room-rental to a “gender feminist critical” group in 2019. 

The question of room bookings and hate groups remerged the following year when the American Library Association’s (ALA) Office of Intellectual Freedom attempted to explicitly include “hate groups” as protected by the Library Bill of Rights room-booking policy \cite{yorio-peet-2018}. The ALA membership pushed back against this inclusion and eventually overturned it, but it exposed the OIF as traditional guarantors of IF-absolutism within the profession. In 2019, the issue came up again, this time around Meghan Murphy, a controversial “gender critical feminist” who had been banned from Twitter in late 2018 for violating Twitter’s policy on transphobia by misgendering another user \cite{brean-2019}. In January 2019, Murphy was invited by a local group to be part of a panel on “Gender Identity and Women’s Rights”. Murphy, like Peterson, objects to Bill C-16. Despite defending the library’s decision to rent space for the panel in the same terms as Vickery Bowles did, Vancouver Public Library also changed their policy in the aftermath of protests. The amended VPL policy is intended to “limit the likelihood that prohibited activities, including hate speech (as defined by law), will take place on Library premises, and to assist the Library in identifying events that may require additional preparation by Library staff” \cite{vpl-policy}.
Despite the change to the policy, Vancouver Public Library was banned from marching in the 2019 Vancouver Pride Parade (the University of British Columbia was also banned for similar reasons) \cite{cbc-vpl, cbc-ubc}. Within the profession, the decision by the Vancouver Pride Society was decried as attempted censorship (by IF absolutists) or at best as a tension or conflict between values. In the VPL statement of values (\cite{vpl-values}), “intellectual freedom” is one value out of twelve. Two other values - “community-led planning” and “community partnerships” - indicate a collective view of the library’s role in society. Indeed, many members of the LGBTQIA+ community in Vancouver, with whom the library had been building up community relationships over the past several years, felt betrayed by the decision to allow Meghan Murphy to speak. However, in a statement defending the room rental, VPL argued that rather than one value among many, to be balanced and integrated, intellectual freedom was rather the single overriding core value for libraries: “the fundamental role of libraries as a place for free expression and intellectual freedom must be upheld”.
It is precisely in this “tension between values” approach that the absolutist nature of hegemonic IF becomes clear. Whenever values come into conflict, for any reason, Intellectual Freedom always wins out. Supporters of this view tend to fall back on legal and juridical frameworks, claiming that the First Amendment, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, or the UN Declaration of Human Rights prevent libraries from following any other policy. There is, then, a clear hierarchy which places community values at the bottom - to be adhered to in times of stability and peace - and the constituted power of the liberal-democratic juridical framework at the top. One of the main goals of this thesis is to understand the relationships between that hierarchy and two distinct constitutional models. On the one hand, there is the recognition-based model which has been dominant in Canada since the 1970s and which was formalized within political theory in the early and mid 1990s. On the other hand, there is the theory of constitutional power elaborated by Antonio Negri. One of the main claims in this project is that consciously or unconsciously, Canadian librarianship’s conception of IF is informed by a politics of recognition that tries to be progressive, but which ends up supporting and reproducing the structural inequities of settler-colonial, cisnormative, patriarchal capitalism. An alternative conception of IF, one informed by Negri’s Marxist politics, might help provide a different way of thinking about IF which might help support and maintain projects of resistance and social justice within Canadian libraries.
In addition to the goal for librarianship, however, there is a broader goal in terms of political theory. We will look at the various critiques of the liberal-idealist politics of recognition formulated by people like Charles Taylor, Axel Honneth, and Will Kymlicka, but each of these critiques ends up seeming one-sided, connected to particular struggles (e.g. Indigenous sovereignty or trans rights). The application of Negri’s general theory of constituent power to the critique of the politics of recognition will, I hope, prove to be a significant contribution to political theory. Before turning to the politics of recognition and its critique, however, I want to trace the connection of Intellectual Freedom in libraries to the classical liberal tradition, and to show how the politics of recognition and IF are connected via the UN Declaration of Human Rights.</Text>
            <Comments>For her defence of renting space for the Kulaszka memorial, Bowles won the 2018 Les Fowlie Intellectual Freedom Award from the Ontario Library Association. The next year’s winner was James Turk. We will have occasion to discuss Bowles and Turk in more detail later on.
While the ALA does not have official authority over the profession, as the oldest and largest library association, it holds considerable hegemony within the field, especially in North America. ALA is also the accrediting body for professional library education in Canada and the US.</Comments>

            <Title>"Non-Cultural" Identity and the Limits of Recognition</Title>
            <Text>From the beginning, the political theory of recognition (which I should distinguish from the “politics of recognition” operationalized by the Canadian state) has been constrained by its reduction of difference to “cultural difference”. As Coulthard points out, the power imbalance between the settler state and Indigenous peoples is not a cultural difference but a material one. Furthermore, drawing on the work of Kanien’kehá:ka scholar Taiaiake Alfred, Coulthard notes that   Indigenous sovereignty and relationship to the land must be anti-capitalist; any attempt to reduce the difference between capitalist and non-capitalist modes of production as “cultural” can only serve the interests of capitalist hegemony. A capitalist mode of production cannot “recognize” a non-capitalist one, but must attempt to overcome or assimilate it. 
Similarly, Nancy Fraser has shown how the politics of recognition channels activism and insurgency away from redistribution, with the result that 
\begin{quote}
the most salient social movements are no longer economically defined ‘classes’ who are struggling to defend their ‘interests’, end ‘exploitation’, and win ‘redistribution’. Instead, they are culturally defined ‘groups’ or ‘communities of values’ who are struggling to defend their ‘identities’, end ‘cultural domination’, and win ‘recognition’. The result is a decoupling of cultural politics from social politics, and the relative eclipse of the latter by the former. \citep[2]{Fraser1997}
\end{quote}

Even more dangerously, “recognition” can end up more deeply implicating marginalized identities in the administrative structures of medicine and the police, subjecting trans people, for example, to unwanted medicalized intervention, police brutality, and the carceral logic of the state. Trans activist, prison abolitionist, and Seattle university law professor Dean Spade, has argued that the recognition of trans identities in, for example, hate speech codes (such as Canada’s Bill C-16 which we will have cause to revisit later), while a seemingly laudable development, can in fact inscribe transgender people in structures of administrative subjection, making them more subject to alienation and oppression under capitalism \citep{Spade2015}.
In many ways it is the very intersectionality of these critiques that challenges the purported universalism of liberal theory (in both its individualist and communitarian variants). The primacy of “always already” existing social relationships, the material (i.e. non-cultural) vectors of inequality, such as rights over land or medically enshrined binaries of sex and gender, and the rejection of individualist and idealist conceptions of rights and equality appear to challenge the political theory of recognition itself. However, the political theory of recognition is, as we have seen, the product of particular debates within liberalism, as well as specific Canadian political problems, which raises the question of whether a non-liberal, anti-capitalist politics of recognition is possible, a politics of recognition which is able to take on board the critiques of Coulthard, Fraser, Spade, and others, to unify them without losing their specific focus and differences. In order to try to answer this question, I will look at recent issues surrounding Intellectual Freedom in Canadian libraries which touch on all of these topics. In Canada, I will argue, Intellectual Freedom is strongly informed by the politics of recognition; what would a liberatory Intellectual Freedom look like based on this alternative conception of the politics of recognition?</Text>
