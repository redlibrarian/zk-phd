Discusses the monological and dialogical ideas of identity formation and the conception of individual freedom it entails (Hegel, Taylor, Honneth). Looks as the non-binary relationship of freedom/necessity as it appears in Engels, Spinoza, and Negri. Follows up the ways this theory of identity informs the politics of recognition. How would a Negrean, non-dialogical conception of identity affect the politics of recognition and intellectual freedom?

Possible epigraphs: 

“If we may take an example from outside the sphere of production of material objects, a schoolmaster is a productive labourer when, in addition to belabouring the heads of his scholars, he works like a horse to enrich the school proprietor. That the latter has laid out his capital in a teaching factory, instead of in a sausage factory, does not alter the relation. “

Marx, Capital, Volume 1.

“The various institutions of modern society should be viewed as an archipelago of factories if subjectivity. In the course of a life, an individual passes linearly into and out of these various institutions (from the school to the barracks to the factory) and is formed by them.”

Hardt and Negri, Empire.
