Something I forgot to include in Opposite Realities is the centrality of “ideology” in the Marxist sense, not as false consciousness or the adherence to political perspectives (as opposed to some purportedly objective or neutral stance) but as “a mechanism whereby the conscious (and unconscious) individual biological subject situates himself or herself within the collective social structure: ideology as a kind of unconscious cognitive mapping” \cite[x]{Jameson2019}

Jameson also points out that there are no areas of life which are non-ideological. This “illusion” is “most easily entertained in moments of historical stasis” [ix]. This is a a good up-to-date quote to use instead of Bhaskar’s contrary way of putting it, which is that ideologies become explicit in moments of crisis. 

Jameson sees ideology as one way of uniting the subjective and the objective. For Taylor, “frameworks” are completely subjective, they are really chosen by the individual (individualism) and have one-way causal effects on the world (idealism), while for someone like Althusser, ideologies are completely objective (i.e. structurally deterministic). Jameson takes a more dialectical approach which I think fits with the social ontological argument I make in Opposite Realities. Individuals and especially [[Gramsci - Intellectuals]] are not isolated, autonomous self-constructed subjects. There has to be a distinction drawn between pure subjectivity (Taylor) - subjectivization (Jameson, Hardt and Negri) - subjection (Spade, with subjection seen as more of an Althusserian overdetermination, or at least a deformation).
