If we understand modern conceptions of enlightement/freedom as emerging from Kant (either, in Tully’s words, as a critical ethos [Foucault] or a critical theory [Habermas]), then we can see Hegel’s “absolute wisdom” as part of that tendency. I think Marx is often considered to be part of that line, but his focus on ideology, historical necessity, and the primacy of social relations, makes him stand out. But in any event, I think that Negri bypasses that whole enlightenment tradition out of Kant and goes back to a very different conception of enlightenment in Spinoza: the achievement of happiness in the Ethics. If Habermasian communicative reason/action argues that we should desire things because they are good (justified), Spinoza takes the opposite view, that things are good because we desire them.
