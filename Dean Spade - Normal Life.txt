I wasn’t expecting Spade to refer, even obliquely, to recognition, but there it is:

“This book has two primary goals. First, it aims to chart the current trajectory of trans politics, one that I argue is recapitulating the limits of leftist, lesbian and gay, feminist and antiracist politics that have centred legal recognition and equality claims. Second, it seeks to elaborate on the possibilities of what I understand as a critical trans politics - that is, a trans politics that demands more than legal recognition and inclusion, seeking instead to transform current logics of state, civil society security, and social equality.” \cite[1]{Spade2015}
