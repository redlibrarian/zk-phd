I think Negri sees two results of the crisis of the late Middle Ages: the popular revolts shook the “natural” order and hierarchy of the world and, along with the decline in population due to the Black Death, in Federici’s view, gave the peasantry and the workers a sense of their own significance and self-sufficiency: the feudal lords needed them, they did not need the lords. In philosophical terms, this is mirrored by the new human dignity of the Renaissance humanists, the devaluing of scholastic transcendence and authority. Negri writes that both the Judaic and Scholastic ontologies were “dual” in the sense that there was one ontology of the physical world of human beings, and another of God; one immanent, the other transcendent. Both the popular revolts and the development of humanism challenged this perspective. The challenge was levelled at both the nobility/aristocracy and the developing merchant/capitalist class, who therefore joined forces (this is in Federici too). Philosophy was pressed into service to offer new (non-Scholastic) justifications for transcendent authority - Descartes is one example (the soul rules the body) and Hobbes is another (the sovereign/state/Leviathan rules the people). When Negri says that “Hobbes becomes Marx of the bourgeoisie”, I think what he’s trying to say is that in the crisis of the Late Middle Ages “all that is solid melts into air” and that therefore Hobbes’ philosophy can be read as a philosophy of deliverance and restoration of a true and just order that the bourgeoisie needed to give themselves a programme. Hobbes will have seen the passing of transcendental authority and the popular revolts (not just of the Civil War) as an indication that without the transcendental authority of God, human beings will just be at each other’s throats, and his philosophy is an attempt to offer a way to control that.

I think read Huizinga on the crisis.
