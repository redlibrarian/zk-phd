Hegel - Closure
============

The idea of “closure” comes up again and again in (especially Marxist?) readings of Hegel. I presume that the dialectical materialist reading of Hegel (check in Ilyenkov) is OK with the idea of teleology/closure/end of history, but Jameson argues that we (postmodernists) can’t take such claims seriously. The first chapter of his Hegel Variations (2010) is called, appropriately enough, “closure”, and in it Jameson argues that the final chapters of [[Hegel - Phenomenology of Spirit]] on “Absolute Spirit” (fore)close the openness of the work, turning it from an open-ended investigation of the dialectic into “a developmental narrative, one that can be characterized variously as teleological or cyclical, but which in either case is to be vigorously repudiated by modern, or at least by contemporary thought of whatever persuasion” (1). A (productive? useful?) reading of the PoS appropriate to our time would have to exclude the last chapters in order to recuperate Hegel for an open, ongoing process of historical understanding and struggle for freedom.
