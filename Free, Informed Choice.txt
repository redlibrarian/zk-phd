Traces the points of agreement and contest between Tully’s conceptions of constitutionalism and civic freedom with Negri’s theory of constituent power. 

The individualistic theory of identity supports an “intellectual freedom constitutionalism” in librarianship, in which self-determining individuals’ free choice of intellectual activity, ideas, values, etc, leads to an informed citizenry which is a necessary condition for democracy. The generative theory of identity formation challenges this idea and opens space for Negri’s theory of constitutuent power. What effects does this have on intellectual freedom and the self-images of libraries as “arsenals of a democratic culture”?

“The major ideological currents of this period were directed towards producing a unified nation based on the free informed choice of individuals rather than on measures of indoctrination in behalf of any particular group.” Sidney Ditzion, Arsenals of a Democratic Culture.

“The notion of constituent power is more suffocated than developed by the concept of a nation.” Negri, Insurgencies.
