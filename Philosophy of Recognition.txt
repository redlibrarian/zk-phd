In talking about the Philosophy of Recognition, the outline should look like this:

Charles Taylor (1992) as, in a way, an inaugurator -> Axel Honneth’s more rigorous version (1992), based on a better reading of Hegel -> Tully (1995) as applying Taylor’s view to constitutionalism -> Fraser (1997) as the beginning of critique and -> Honneth and Fraser (2003) to round out the “precritical” conception of the politics of recognition.
